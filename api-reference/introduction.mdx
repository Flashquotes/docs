## Welcome to the Flashquotes API

The Flashquotes API enables you to programmatically access and manage your events, bookings, forms, and invoices. Our REST API provides endpoints for retrieving event data, managing form responses, and accessing invoice information.

<Tip>
	API access is limited to Flashquotes Pro plan customers. You can easily
	upgrade in [Plan Settings](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/plans).
</Tip>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. You must include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
'x-api-key: your_api_key_here'
```

<Note>
	Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. If you're subscribed to
	the Pro plan, access your API key in the [Integrations
	Settings](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/integrations).
</Note>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```bash
https://app.flashquotes.com/api
```

## Available Endpoints

Our API provides several endpoint groups:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="Event Endpoints" icon="calendar">
  Manage events, retrieve event details, and list events within date ranges
</Card>

<Card title="Form Response Endpoints" icon="clipboard">
	Access form submission data and response details
</Card>

<Card title="Invoice Endpoints" icon="file-invoice">
  Retrieve invoice information and payment details
</Card>
</CardGroup>
## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses will have a 2xx status code, while errors will return appropriate 4xx or 5xx status codes with error details.

## Rate Limiting

Currently, the Flashquotes API does not implement rate limiting. While this provides maximum flexibility for integration development, we recommend implementing reasonable request throttling in your applications to ensure optimal performance.

<Note>
Rate limiting may be added in future versions. We will provide advance notice of any changes to API usage policies.
