## Overview

A booking in Flashquotes represents a client's confirmed service agreement, which may include one or multiple event days. Each booking serves as an umbrella that contains payment terms, event details, and client information. Bookings can be created automatically through your booking form or manually for special cases.

## Booking Structure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="calendar" title="Understanding Bookings vs Events">
    In Flashquotes, there's an important distinction between bookings and events:
    
    - **Booking**: The overall service agreement that includes payment terms and client details
    - **Event**: A single day of service within a booking
    
    <Info>
      One booking can contain multiple events (service days), all managed under a single invoice.
    </Info>

    Each booking includes:
    
    - Booking form responses
    - Payment information
    - Client details
    - Associated events
    - Invoice details
    - Dynamic booking confirmation
