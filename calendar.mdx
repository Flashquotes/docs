## Overview

The Calendar in Flashquotes provides a comprehensive visual overview of your upcoming events and leads. It serves as both an event management tool and a lightweight CRM, helping you track both confirmed bookings and potential business opportunities.

## Calendar Features

  <Accordion icon="calendar-check" title="Booked Events">
    Confirmed bookings appear as solid blocks and include:
    - Event date and time
    - Client information
    - Quick access to event details
    
    <Tip>
      Click any booked event to view a slide-out panel with event details or access the full event editing interface.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="calendar-days" title="Potential Leads">
    Unbooked leads appear as dashed-line blocks and show:
    - Requested date
    - Lead information
    - Quote status

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reports Section

### Guest Count Analysis

<AccordionGroup>

      Select custom date ranges (e.g., two weeks) to view consolidated guest counts for accurate resource planning.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="box" title="Resource Planning">
    Use guest count reports to:
