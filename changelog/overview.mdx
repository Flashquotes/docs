PRO plan customers can now sync their financial data with QuickBooks Online. The integration automatically creates customers, invoices, payments, and deposits in QuickBooks, with configurable account mappings and tax codes.

Payments are synced in real-time, including proper handling of sales tax and processing fees. The integration maintains your QuickBooks data structure while ensuring accurate financial reporting.

For more details, check out the [QuickBooks integration docs](/settings/integrations/quickbooks).

## Service Area Configuration

Define your service radius to automatically validate event addresses during quote submission. The system checks addresses in real-time against your specified radius. For events outside your service area, a warning banner notifies the client that additional travel fees may apply.

Your service area is defaulted to 150 miles, but you can change this in **[Quote Settings](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/quotes)**.
