<Update label="November 13, 2025">

## Rich Text Editor for Special Notes

Special notes on quotes and events now use a visual rich text editor instead of Markdown. Format your internal notes with bold, italic, headings, lists, links, and dividers using familiar toolbar buttons - no Markdown syntax required.

**What's New:**
- **Visual Formatting Toolbar**: Format text with buttons instead of typing Markdown
- **Full Formatting Support**: Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, headings (H1-H3), bullet and numbered lists, horizontal rules, and links
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) to save quickly
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing Markdown notes automatically convert when you edit them

Perfect for creating well-organized internal notes with clear structure and formatting. Special notes remain internal-only and are not visible to customers.

<Update label="November 12, 2025">

## Import Bookings from CSV

Save time migrating data or adding historical bookings with the new CSV import feature. Upload up to 100 bookings at once using a simple spreadsheet format, perfect for businesses transitioning from other systems or adding past events to Flashquotes.

**What's New:**
- **CSV Template**: Download a pre-formatted template with all required fields and example data
- **Column Mapping**: Upload your CSV and map columns to Flashquotes fields with auto-matching
- **Real-time Validation**: Errors are highlighted before import with specific guidance on fixes
- **Background Processing**: Large imports run in the background with progress tracking and detailed results

**How It Works:**
1. Download the CSV template from the Import Bookings page
2. Fill in your booking data with event details, client info, and pricing
3. Upload and map your columns to Flashquotes fields
4. Review validation, fix any errors, then import
5. Track progress and view results with success/failure breakdown

Imported bookings include all event details, timeline entries, and trigger event brief tasks automatically. Email notifications are not sent during import to avoid duplicate communications.

</Update>

<Update label="November 4, 2025">

## Google Calendar Sync Timing Options <PlusBadge />

Choose whether calendar events sync based on **service time** (customer-facing event hours) or **shift time** (full staff shift including setup, breakdown, and travel). This affects how events appear in your Google Calendar - either showing just the service window or your complete time commitment for each booking.

[Configure calendar sync timing →](/settings/integrations/google-calendar#choose-service-time-or-shift-time)

</Update>

<Update label="November 3, 2025">

## Shortcodes in Default Quote Email Body

Set your template once and every quote email automatically includes personalized details. Live preview shows how your email renders with real quote data before saving.

## Quote Requested Workflow Trigger

Automatically engage leads the moment they submit a quote request through your lead intake forms. The new Quote Requested workflow trigger enrolls leads in customized email sequences immediately after form submission, helping you nurture interest before you even send a formal quote.

**What's New:**
- **Automatic Enrollment**: Leads who submit your lead intake form are automatically enrolled in Quote Requested workflows
- **Customizable Sequences**: Create personalized email templates that send while you're preparing their quote
- **Smart Timing**: Engage leads during the critical window between request and quote delivery
- **Gmail Integration**: Choose which connected Gmail account sends workflow emails

**How It Works:**
When a lead submits your intake form, Flashquotes automatically enrolls them in any active Quote Requested workflows. These emails can acknowledge their submission, share your company story, provide helpful planning tips, or build excitement while you prepare their custom quote.

**Perfect For:**
- Immediate acknowledgment emails confirming quote request receipt
- Educational content about your services while leads wait
- Building trust and rapport before the first formal quote
- Keeping leads engaged during your quote preparation process

Quote Requested workflows complement the existing Quote Sent workflows, giving you complete automation coverage from initial inquiry through booking.

<Update label="October 27, 2025">

## Enhanced Quote Expiration for Last-Minute Bookings

Quotes now expire at **midnight the day before the event** instead of at the event start time. This prevents your team from having a last minute booking without first confirming that you can service the event.

**What Changed:**
- Event on Oct 27 at 2pm MST → Quote expires Oct 26 at 12am MST (previously expired at 2pm Oct 27)
- Expired last-minute quotes now show specialized messaging encouraging customers to contact your team

This change automatically applies to all new quotes and better supports last-minute event bookings.

</Update>

<Update label="October 23, 2025">

## Workflow Management Enhancements

You can now customize workflow sequences to match your sales process:

- **Add Steps**: Insert additional follow-up emails at any position in your workflow with custom timing, subject and email body
- **Delete Steps**: Remove steps that don't fit your strategy (immediately stops them from sending, even for active workflows)
- **Resume Workflows**: Restart stopped workflows from the Lead Workflows tab when leads re-engage

## Gmail Integration Enhancements <PlusBadge />

We've improved the email composer and workflow automation for [Pro/Plus subscribers](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/plans) with Full Gmail Integration.

**What's New:**
- **Easily compose new email**: Click the email icon on any lead in the list view to start composing a new message
- **Workflow auto-stop on email reply**: When leads reply to emails, active quote follow-up workflows deactivate automatically. This ensures you never send automated follow-ups after a lead has already responded, maintaining a personal touch throughout the sales process.

Save time and ensure consistent pricing with our new Instant Pricing feature. Now you can set up automatic price calculations for your services based on:

- Base service price
- Hourly rates per staff member
- Per-guest pricing
- Minimum price thresholds

When leads submit your intake forms, Flashquotes automatically generates draft quotes using your predefined pricing rules. This ensures consistent pricing across your business while still giving you the flexibility to review and adjust quotes before sending them to clients.

Check out our [Instant Pricing guide](/leads/instant-pricing) to learn how to set up automated pricing for your services.
