The quote editor now features a live preview as you build, showing exactly how your quote will appear to clients. Customize the hero text at the top of your quotes using markdown formatting for **bold** statements and embedded links. For more details, check out the [quote page docs](/docs/quotes).

Brand your quotes with custom hero images for each quote or set a default in company settings. Your brand colors now extend throughout customer-facing pages - set your signature color in **Settings > Branding** to have buttons and icons match your visual identity.

</Frame>

Managing sales tax across multiple jurisdictions is now simpler with our new automated tax reporting. Access comprehensive tax summaries under **Invoices > Sales Tax** to see your total sales, taxable amounts, and taxes owed.

The report breaks down tax data by rate, making it easy to handle different tax jurisdictions. All payment data in Flashquotes automatically flows into these reports, ensuring your numbers are always current.

Need historical data? Filter the report by different time periods, from last month to year-to-date, to get exactly the information you need for tax remittance.

## Resource Selection in Booking Forms

<Frame>

  />
</Frame>

Let clients choose their preferred cart directly in your booking form with our new Resource Select question type. The form shows only carts available for the selected event date, complete with photos and descriptions you can customize in the resource settings.

When a booking is confirmed, the selected cart is automatically assigned to the event, streamlining your workflow and ensuring clients get exactly the setup they want.

## Native email sending

Now you can fire off **quote emails** directly from the quote page. Client quote emails include a link to the quote presentation page and the Book Now button
Click the new "Copy share link" button if you still want to copy/paste the quote link into a separate email

You can also send **invoice reminders** to clients with a single click. Preview the email before sending to ensure it looks great. Emails are branded with your logo and include a direct link to pay.
