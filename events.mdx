## Overview

The Events view provides a comprehensive operational overview of your upcoming events, including task status, staff assignments, resource allocation, and payment tracking. It serves as a central hub for managing all aspects of event delivery.

## Events Dashboard

### Status Indicators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-check" title="Visual Status System">
    The dashboard uses color coding to track event status:
    - **Green**: Completed tasks, fully staffed, resources assigned
    - **Yellow**: Incomplete tasks, requires attention
    - **Red**: Critical issues - staff shortage, resource shortage, overdue payments

    Status indicators appear for:
    - Admin task completion
    - Staff assignments
    - Resource allocation
    - Payment status (Paid, Pending, Partially paid, Open, Overdue, Draft)

    <Info>
      These visual indicators help quickly identify events that need immediate attention.

  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Copying Events vs Bookings">
    Flashquotes offers two distinct copying features to help you quickly handle repeat business and multi-day services:

    **Copying an Event (Add Another Service Day)**
    - Creates a new event within the SAME booking
    - Shares the same invoice and payment structure
    - Perfect for adding another service day to an existing booking
    - Example: Client wants to add a second day of service to their wedding weekend
    - Access via: Event details page → "Make a copy" button

    **Copying a Booking (Duplicate Entire Booking)**
    - Creates an entirely NEW booking with new invoice
    - Duplicates all events from the original booking
    - Generates fresh invoice and payment schedule
    - Perfect for repeat clients or similar events
    - Example: Client loved your service and wants to book you for next year's event
    - Access via: Booking details page → Copy booking option

    <Tip>
      **Quick Guide:**
      - Same client, additional day = Copy Event
      - New occasion or repeat booking = Copy Booking
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      When you copy an event, the new event inherits most details from the original (staff, resources, timeline) but you can customize the date, time, and specific requirements.
    </Note>
