## Overview

The Event Brief serves as the day-of-service documentation for your team. It provides a shareable, dynamic document that contains all necessary information for successful event execution, accessible via a public link without requiring a Flashquotes account.

Each event brief includes customizable checklists that ensure your staff knows exactly what to pack, what to do, and how to put on a great event. You can create multiple checklists per event and save them as templates to use in other events.

<Note>
  **Pro Subscription Features**: Multiple checklists per event and template management require a Flashquotes Pro subscription. Free plans include one checklist per event with basic task management.

    Use multiple checklists to organize complex events:
    - Create role-specific checklists (e.g., "Lead Barista", "Setup Crew")
