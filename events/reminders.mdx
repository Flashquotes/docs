# Reminders

Reminders are important flags or notes that can be attached to events to highlight critical information for your staff. They appear prominently in both the event details and event brief pages, ensuring that crucial information is never missed.

## How Reminders Work

### Adding Reminders

You can add reminders to any event through the Notes widget in two ways:

- Select from existing company reminders in the dropdown
- Create new reminders by typing in the "Add new reminder..." input field

Once added, reminders are immediately visible on the event and will be displayed to all staff members who have access to the event.

### Visibility and Display

Reminders are strategically displayed in two key locations:

1. In the "Prep & Loading" section of the event brief
2. In the Notes widget of the event details page

For high visibility, reminders appear as pink pill badges with a dot indicator. Multiple reminders can be added to a single event and are automatically sorted alphabetically for easy reference.

### Warning Banner

When an event has reminders attached, a warning banner appears at the top of the event brief. This feature ensures that:

- Staff members are immediately aware of important information before starting their shift
- Critical information from both reminders and add-ons is prominently displayed
- Important details cannot be overlooked

## Managing Reminders

### Adding and Removing Reminders

- **Adding**: Use the dropdown menu to select existing company reminders or create new ones
- **Removing**: Simply deselect reminders from the dropdown to remove them
- **Company-wide Reminders**: Available across all events for consistency
- **Custom Reminders**: Can be created for specific events as needed

## Best Practices

To make the most of the Reminders feature, follow these guidelines:

1. **Keep it Critical**: Use reminders for truly important information that staff must be aware of
2. **Be Concise**: Keep reminder text short and clear
3. **Stay Consistent**: Use standardized reminders across similar events
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review reminders to ensure they remain relevant
5. **Standardize**: Create company-wide reminders for common situations

## Common Use Cases

Reminders are particularly useful for:

- Equipment requirements
- Safety precautions
- Special client requests
- Setup requirements
- Venue-specific instructions
- Dietary restrictions or allergies
- Special handling instructions

By using reminders effectively, you can ensure that important information is prominently displayed and doesn't get lost in longer notes or instructions.
