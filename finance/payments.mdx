## Understanding Payment Statuses

### Succeeded

Payment has been successfully processed and funds will be deposited according to your Stripe payout schedule.

### Pending

Bank transfer is in process but payment has not settled. Funds typically clear within 2-3 business days. Invoice balance calculations include pending amounts.

### Processing

Payment is currently being processed by Stripe. This status typically updates within a few minutes.

### Failed

Payment attempt was unsuccessful. Common reasons include:

- Insufficient funds
- Card declined
- Invalid card details
- Bank authentication required

<Tip>
	For failed payments, the dashboard displays the specific error message from
	Stripe to help you communicate with your client about resolution.
