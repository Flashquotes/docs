## Overview

The Payouts dashboard shows when funds from customer payments will be deposited into your bank account. Stripe payouts transfer your available balance to your bank on a schedule you configure in your Stripe account settings.

## What You'll See

The dashboard displays:
- **Upcoming payouts** with expected deposit dates
- **Payout history** showing past deposits
- **Available balance** ready for payout
- **Individual transactions** included in each payout

Most businesses receive payouts on a 2-day rolling basis, meaning payments made on Monday are deposited on Wednesday. Your specific schedule depends on your Stripe account configuration.

## Instant Payouts

Need funds immediately? If your Stripe account is eligible, you can request an instant payout to receive funds within 30 minutes. This feature is useful for urgent expenses but includes an additional fee (typically 1% of the payout amount).

To request an instant payout:
1. Check your available balance in the dashboard
2. Click "Request Instant Payout"
3. Enter the amount you need
4. Funds arrive within 30 minutes
