title: "Custom item mapping"
description: "Map specific services, add-ons, and service charges to QuickBooks items"
---

Override default QuickBooks item mappings for specific services, add-ons, and service charges. Use this when certain items need different accounting treatment than your defaults.

## When you need this

**Common scenarios:**
- Service requires different income account
- Add-on must track to a specific category
- Service charge must track to specific expense account
- Package pricing needs separate tracking

Default mappings handle most cases. Only create custom mappings when specific items need different QuickBooks items.

<Note>
Requires QuickBooks Online integration and Pro subscription. [Set up QuickBooks](/settings/integrations/quickbooks) first.
</Note>

## How mappings work

**Priority order:**
1. Custom mapping (if exists) → uses specified QuickBooks item
2. Default mapping → uses line item type default
3. No mapping → uses QuickBooks default mapping (usually "Sales")

**Example:** You have "Coffee Cart" service mapped to "Premium Catering" item. All other services use the default "Catering Services" item.

## Create a custom mapping

1. Go to Settings > Integrations > QuickBooks
2. Scroll to Line Item Custom Mapping section
3. Click **Add Mapping**
4. Select type: Service, Add-on, or Service Charge
5. Choose Flashquotes item from dropdown
6. Select QuickBooks item from dropdown
7. Mapping saves automatically

What happens next: Future syncs use the custom QuickBooks item for that specific Flashquotes item. Existing invoices in QuickBooks aren't changed.

## View existing mappings

All custom mappings appear in the Line Item Custom Mapping card.

**What you see:**
- Type (Service, Add-on, or Service Charge)
- Flashquotes item name
- Mapped QuickBooks item name
- Delete button (hover to reveal)

## Delete a mapping

1. Go to Settings > Integrations > QuickBooks
2. Find the mapping in Line Item Custom Mapping
3. Hover over the row
4. Click trash icon

What happens next: Future syncs use the default mapping for that line item type. Existing QuickBooks records aren't changed.

## Mapping rules

**One mapping per item:**
- Each Flashquotes item can have one custom mapping
- Updating a mapping replaces the previous one
- Multiple items can map to the same QuickBooks item

**Deletions:**
- Deleting a Flashquotes item removes its custom mapping
- Deleted mappings can't be recovered
- Default mapping takes over immediately

## Common issues

- **Mapping not saving**: Check you selected both Flashquotes item and QuickBooks item
- **Wrong item syncing**: Custom mappings override defaults - check custom mappings first
- **Can't find QuickBooks item**: Click Refresh button to update QuickBooks data
- **Mapping disappeared**: Flashquotes item may have been deleted

## Best practices

1. **Start with defaults** - Only create custom mappings when needed
2. **Document your mappings** - Note why specific items need custom treatment
3. **Review quarterly** - Ensure mappings still make sense
4. **Test with one invoice** - Verify mapping works before bulk syncing
