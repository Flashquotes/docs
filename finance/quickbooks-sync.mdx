Flashquotes syncs payments, deposits, and refunds to QuickBooks Online. This page covers how sync works and how to manually sync individual transactions.

<Note>
QuickBooks sync requires an active Pro subscription and QuickBooks Online connection. Set up QuickBooks integration first in [Settings → Integrations](/settings/integrations/quickbooks).
</Note>

## How deposits work

Flashquotes creates QuickBooks deposits differently depending on the payment method:

**Stripe payments** — Deposits are created automatically when Stripe sends the payout to your bank. Multiple payments from the same payout are grouped into a single aggregate deposit that matches your bank statement. Each deposit includes the Stripe payout trace ID in the memo field for easy bank reconciliation.

**Manual payments** (cash, check) — Deposits are created immediately when you sync the payment to QuickBooks.

### Failed payouts

If a Stripe payout fails, Flashquotes automatically removes the corresponding deposit from QuickBooks and clears the deposit link from affected payments. No manual cleanup is needed.

## Sync a payment

1. Go to an invoice with payment activity
2. Find the payment in the Payment Activity table
3. Click **Sync Payment** next to the payment
4. Wait for sync to complete (button shows loading spinner)

What happens next: The payment syncs to QuickBooks as an invoice and payment record. For manual payments (cash, check), a bank deposit is also created immediately. For Stripe payments, the deposit is created later when the payout arrives. The sync button disappears and shows a QuickBooks icon.

## Sync a refund

1. Go to an invoice with refund activity
2. Find the refund in the Payment Activity table
3. Click **Sync Refund** next to the refund
4. Wait for sync to complete

What happens next: The refund syncs to QuickBooks as a refund record. You'll see a QuickBooks icon showing the sync is complete.

## When to use manual sync

Use manual sync when:
- QuickBooks connection was set up after payments were processed
- You want to sync only specific transactions
- Automatic sync failed for individual payments
- You need to control timing of accounting entries

## Prerequisites

Before syncing payments, verify these settings in QuickBooks integration:

- **Deposit bank account**: Where payments are deposited
- **Fee expense account**: For processing fees
- **Refund bank account**: For refund transactions (refunds only)

<Warning>
Missing account mappings will cause sync to fail. Check your QuickBooks integration settings if sync doesn't work.
</Warning>

## Common issues

- **Sync button not visible**: Check you have Pro subscription and QuickBooks connected
- **"Already synced" error**: Payment was previously synced to QuickBooks
- **"Invoice already paid" error**: QuickBooks invoice has zero balance remaining
- **Account mapping missing**: Set up required bank and expense accounts in QuickBooks settings
- **Deposit not appearing yet**: For Stripe payments, deposits are created when the payout reaches your bank (typically 1-2 business days)

## What gets created in QuickBooks

**For payments:**
- Invoice record (if not already exists)
- Payment record linked to invoice
- Bank deposit (immediately for manual payments; on payout for Stripe payments)

**For Stripe payout deposits:**
- Single aggregate deposit grouping all payments from the payout
- Stripe processing fees recorded as expense line items
- Payout trace ID in the deposit memo for bank reconciliation

**For refunds:**
- Refund record
- Bank account deduction

## Limitations

- Can only sync payments with valid amounts greater than $0
- Previously synced payments can't be synced again
- Requires customer email to match or create QuickBooks customer
- Stripe fees and Flashquotes fees are automatically calculated and recorded
