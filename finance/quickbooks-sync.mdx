Sync specific payments and refunds to QuickBooks when you need manual control over your accounting records.

## When you need this

Use manual sync when:
- QuickBooks connection was set up after payments were processed
- You want to sync only specific transactions
- Automatic sync failed for individual payments
- You need to control timing of accounting entries

<Note>
Manual sync requires an active Pro subscription and QuickBooks Online connection. Set up QuickBooks integration first in [Settings → Integrations](/settings/integrations/quickbooks).
</Note>

## Sync a payment

1. Go to an invoice with payment activity
2. Find the payment in the Payment Activity table
3. Click **Sync Payment** next to the payment
4. Wait for sync to complete (button shows loading spinner)

What happens next: The payment syncs to QuickBooks as an invoice, payment record, and bank deposit. The sync button disappears and shows a QuickBooks icon.

## Sync a refund

1. Go to an invoice with refund activity
2. Find the refund in the Payment Activity table
3. Click **Sync Refund** next to the refund
4. Wait for sync to complete

What happens next: The refund syncs to QuickBooks as a refund record. You'll see a QuickBooks icon showing the sync is complete.

## Prerequisites

Before syncing payments, verify these settings in QuickBooks integration:

- **Deposit bank account**: Where payments are deposited
- **Fee expense account**: For processing fees
- **Refund bank account**: For refund transactions (refunds only)

<Warning>
Missing account mappings will cause sync to fail. Check your QuickBooks integration settings if sync doesn't work.
</Warning>

## Common issues

- **Sync button not visible**: Check you have Pro subscription and QuickBooks connected
- **"Already synced" error**: Payment was previously synced to QuickBooks
- **"Invoice already paid" error**: QuickBooks invoice has zero balance remaining
- **Account mapping missing**: Set up required bank and expense accounts in QuickBooks settings

## What gets created in QuickBooks

**For payments:**
- Invoice record (if not already exists)
- Payment record linked to invoice
- Bank deposit with fee deductions

**For refunds:**
- Refund record
- Bank account deduction

## Limitations

- Can only sync payments with valid amounts greater than $0
- Previously synced payments can't be synced again
- Requires customer email to match or create QuickBooks customer
- Stripe fees and flashquotes fees are automatically calculated and recorded
