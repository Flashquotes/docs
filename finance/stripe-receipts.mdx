## Overview

Access official Stripe receipts for payments to provide customers with detailed transaction records. Receipts are automatically generated for all successful Stripe payments and can be accessed directly from your invoice payment tables.

## Finding Receipt Links

Receipt links appear in the **Payment Activity** table on invoice pages:

1. Navigate to **Invoices** from the main menu
2. Click on any invoice to view its details
3. Scroll to the **Payment Activity** section
4. Look for the "Receipt" link next to the "Details" button for Stripe payments

<Note>
  Receipt links are only available for payments processed through Stripe. Manual payments (cash, check, bank transfer) recorded outside of Stripe do not have receipt functionality.

## Troubleshooting

### Customer Didn't Receive Receipt

If a customer reports not receiving their receipt:

1. Verify the payment was successful in the Payment Activity table
2. Check that a valid email address was provided
3. Ask the customer to check spam/junk folders
4. Use the Receipt link to access the receipt and manually forward it

### Receipt Link Not Appearing

Receipt links only appear for:
- Successfully processed Stripe payments
- Payments with completed transactions
- Payments that have receipt URLs generated by Stripe

Manual payments or pending transactions may not have receipt links available.
