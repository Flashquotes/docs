## Overview

The Booking Form collects customer information when they accept a quote. With optimized question pages and a mobile-friendly design, it provides a professional checkout experience for converting quotes into confirmed bookings.

## Form Structure

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="list-check" title="Form Design">
    Features:
    - Single question per page format
    - Mobile-optimized design
    - High conversion rate focus

    <Info>
      The single-question-per-page approach maximizes completion rates, especially on mobile devices.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Customization Options">
    Modify the booking form:
    - Edit existing questions
    - Add new questions
    - Remove unnecessary fields
    - Customize question order
    - Mark questions as required or optional
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="asterisk" title="Required Questions">
    Control which questions are mandatory for form submission:

    1. Open a question in the form editor
    2. Find the "Required" toggle in the question settings
    3. Toggle on to make the question mandatory, or off to make it optional

    **System-Required Questions:**
    - Some questions are required by Flashquotes and cannot be changed
    - These questions show "This question is required by Flashquotes" instead of a toggle
    - System-required questions ensure essential data is collected for booking processing

    **User-Required Questions:**
    - You can mark custom questions as required or optional
    - Required questions must be completed before form submission
    - Optional questions allow customers to skip if not applicable

    <Tip>
      Balance required fields carefully—too many required questions can reduce conversion rates, while too few may result in incomplete booking information.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="git-branch" title="Conditional Logic">
    Show or hide form pages based on the service or add-on included in a quote.

    For example, show a "Bar Menu Preferences" page only when a bar service is on the quote—and hide it for everything else.

    - Conditions are set per page in the form editor
    - Pages can match on service type or specific add-ons
    - Customers only see pages relevant to their booking

    <Info>
      Conditional logic is a Plus plan feature. [Upgrade your plan](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/billing) to enable it.
