## Platform-Specific Guides

## Responsive Design

Flashquotes forms are fully responsive and will automatically adjust to fit the container they're placed in. To ensure optimal display:

- Place forms in containers at least 600px wide when possible
- Avoid cramped sidebars for lead intake forms
- Test your embedded forms on multiple device sizes

## Troubleshooting

If your form isn't displaying correctly:

1. Make sure your platform allows iframe embedding (most do)
2. Check that no content blockers are interfering with the iframe
3. Verify you're using the latest embed code from your Flashquotes dashboard
4. Ensure the container has sufficient width for the form to display properly
