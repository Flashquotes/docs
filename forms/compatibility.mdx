## Overview

Flashquotes forms can be integrated with any website platform through iframe embed. This ensures that regardless of which website builder or CMS you use, you can easily incorporate Flashquotes forms into your existing site.

**Don't want to embed?** Use [Share Links](/forms/share-links) instead. Create a Flashquotes-hosted page perfect for social media, Instagram link-in-bio, or direct client sharing.

## Integration Options

### Share Links (No Embedding Required)

Skip embedding entirely with hosted form pages:

1. Navigate to the **Publish** tab in your form editor
2. Copy your share link
3. Use it anywhere - social media, email, or Instagram bio

Perfect for Instagram link-in-bio since Instagram doesn't allow clickable links in posts.

## Platform-Specific Guides

- Theme template files (for developers)

1. Add a **Code Block** to your page
2. Paste the Flashquotes embedding code
3. Save and publish your changes

### Webflow

Webflow users should:

### Wix

To embed a Flashquotes form in Wix:

1. Go to your lead intake form in the Flashquotes dashboard and click **Embed Form**. **Important:** Choose **Wix** from the dropdown menu, as Wix has a unique embed snippet. Copy the embed code snippet.
2. Open your Wix website editor from your Dashboard. Navigate to the page where you want to embed your quote form.
3. Click **Add Elements** and go to the **Embed Code** section, then drag and drop an **Embed HTML** to the place on the page where you'd like your quote form to appear.
4. In the dialog box that appears, paste in your embed code from Flashquotes and click **Apply**.
5. Once you have copied your embed code, you won't have to copy the code again—simply update the design and your embed will be updated. Your embed will also be saved and can be found as an **HTML element** in your site Layers.

## Responsive Design

Flashquotes forms are fully responsive and will automatically adjust to fit the container they're placed in. To ensure optimal display:

- Place forms in containers at least 600px wide when possible
- Avoid cramped sidebars for lead intake forms
- Test your embedded forms on multiple device sizes

## Troubleshooting

If your form isn't displaying correctly:

1. Make sure your platform allows iframe embedding (most do)
2. Check that no content blockers are interfering with the iframe
3. Verify you're using the latest embed code from your Flashquotes dashboard
4. Ensure the container has sufficient width for the form to display properly

## Next Steps

After embedding your forms:

- [Customize form settings](/forms/lead-intake#form-settings)
- [Configure form notifications](/settings/general)
- [Track form submissions](/leads/managing)
