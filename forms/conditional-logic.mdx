## Conditional Form Logic <PlusBadge />

Show different form pages to different customers based on their selections. A customer who picks your espresso bar sees espresso-specific questions. A customer who picks your photo booth doesn't.

<Note>
  Conditional logic is only available on **booking forms**, not lead intake forms. It requires a **Plus** plan or higher. Essentials users will see an upgrade prompt in the Logic tab.
</Note>

## Set up rules on a page

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your booking form editor">
    Go to **Settings → Forms** and open your booking form.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click the Logic tab">
    At the top of the editor, switch from the **Build** tab to the **Logic** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find the page you want to control">
    Each form page shows a card with its name, question count, and current status — either **Always visible** or **N rules**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a rule">
    Click the page card to expand it. Select a rule type:

    - **Service rule** — show this page when a specific service is selected
    - **Add-on rule** — show this page when a specific add-on is selected

    Then pick the service or add-on from the dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add more rules if needed">
    Add as many rules as you want. A page shows if **any** rule matches — not all of them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How rules work

- **No rules set** — the page is always visible to every customer
- **One or more rules** — the page only shows when at least one rule matches
- **Multiple rules use OR logic** — match any rule, not all rules

<Info>
  Example: set two rules on your "Espresso Questions" page — one for your Espresso Bar service and one for your Latte Add-on. The page appears for either selection.
</Info>

## What customers see

When a customer fills out the booking form, pages whose conditions aren't met are automatically skipped. Required fields on hidden pages are also skipped — customers won't get stuck on a question that doesn't apply to them.

## Upgrade to Plus

Conditional logic is a **Plus** plan feature. If you're on Essentials, you'll see a prompt to upgrade when you click the Logic tab.
