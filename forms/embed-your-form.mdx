## Troubleshooting

**Form not showing?**
- Make sure your website platform allows HTML/iframe embeds
- Check that no ad blockers are interfering
- Try copying fresh code from Flashquotes

**Form looks cramped?**
- Place the form in a wider container (at least 600px recommended)
- Avoid putting forms in narrow sidebars

**Need the form on mobile?**
- Flashquotes forms are responsive and work on all devices
- Wix users: see our [mobile optimization guide](/forms/wix-embeds)

## Don't Want to Embed?

Use [Share Links](/forms/share-links) instead. You'll get a Flashquotes-hosted page that's perfect for:
- Instagram link-in-bio
- Social media posts
- Email campaigns
- QR codes on business cards
