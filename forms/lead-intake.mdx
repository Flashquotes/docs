<Accordion icon="asterisk" title="Required Questions">
  Control which questions are mandatory for form submission:

  1. Open a question in the form editor
  2. Find the "Required" toggle in the question settings
  3. Toggle on to make the question mandatory, or off to make it optional

  **System-Required Questions:**
  - Some questions are required by Flashquotes and cannot be changed

  <Accordion icon="magic-wand-sparkles" title="Flashquotes AutoDraft">
    Automatically pre-build draft quotes from every lead:

    1. Set up your default service with pricing

    **How pricing works:**

    - **Without service selection questions**: Uses the fallback service (fixed pricing)
    - **No service selected**: Falls back to the configured default service
    
    When enabled:
    - Quotes are generated instantly upon form submission
    - Clients are redirected to the quote presentation page
