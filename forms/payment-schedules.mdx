## Payment Schedule Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Deposit Only">
    **Best for:** Events that require an upfront deposit to secure the booking
    
    **How it works:**
    - Clients pay a deposit amount when booking
    - The remaining balance is handled outside of Flashquotes (e.g., cash on delivery, separate invoice)
    
    **Configuration options:**
    - **Deposit Type:** Choose between:
      - **Fixed Amount:** Set a specific dollar amount (e.g., $500)
      - **Percentage:** Set a percentage of the total quote (e.g., 20%)
    - **Deposit Amount:** Enter the fixed dollar amount or percentage value
  </Accordion>

<Accordion icon="circle-dollar-to-slot" title="Full Payment">
  **Best for:** Events that require complete payment upfront **How it works:** -
  Clients pay 100% of the quote total when booking - No additional payments
  needed **Configuration options:** - No additional configuration needed -
  clients will be charged the full quote amount
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="calendar-days" title="Payment Plan">
  **Best for:** Higher-value events where clients prefer to spread payments over
  time **How it works:** - Initial deposit to secure the booking - Remaining
  balance split into scheduled installments - Automatic payment collection on
  scheduled dates **Configuration options:** - **Initial Deposit:** - Fixed
  amount or percentage - Collected immediately upon booking - **Number of
  Installments:** How many payments to split the remaining balance into (2-12) -
  **Payment Schedule:** - **Weekly:** Payments collected every week -
  **Bi-weekly:** Payments collected every two weeks - **Monthly:** Payments
  collected once per month - **First Installment Date:** When the payment plan
  begins (must be after the booking date)
</Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-invoice" title="Invoice Only">
    **Best for:** Corporate clients or situations where payment is handled through traditional invoicing
    
    **How it works:**
    - No payment collected through Flashquotes
    - Booking is confirmed without payment
    - You handle invoicing and payment collection separately
    
    **Configuration options:**
    - **Payment Terms:** Set when payment is due (e.g., Net 30, Due on Receipt)
    - **Invoice Notes:** Add any special instructions or payment information
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using Multiple Payment Schedules

### Why Use Multiple Booking Forms?

Different client types often require different payment terms:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Corporate Clients" icon="building">
    Invoice only with Net 30 terms
  </Card>

<Card title="Private Events" icon="party-horn">
  50% deposit required
</Card>

  <Card title="Last-minute Bookings" icon="clock">
    Full payment upfront
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Setting Up Multiple Forms

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Create Separate Forms">
    1. Go to **Forms** → **Create New Form**
    2. Name them clearly (e.g., "Corporate Booking Form", "Standard Booking Form")
    3. Configure each with the appropriate payment schedule
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Configure Payment Schedules">
    1. Edit each form's settings
    2. Set the payment schedule that matches that client type
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Selecting the Right Form When Sending Quotes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Send Quote">Click **Send Quote** on the quote details page</Step>

<Step title="Choose Form">
  In the send quote modal, look for **"Choose a booking form"**
</Step>

  <Step title="Select Appropriate Form">
    Select from the dropdown based on: - Client type (corporate vs. private) -
    Event timeline (rush vs. standard) - Your payment preferences for that
    specific client
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The form you select determines: - Which payment schedule applies - What
  payment options the client sees - How and when payments are collected
</Note>
