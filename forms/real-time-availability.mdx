## Overview

The Real-Time Availability feature provides instant feedback to potential customers about your availability for their desired event dates. This helps set expectations early in the inquiry process and saves you time by reducing requests for dates when you're already fully booked.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup >
  <Accordion icon="calendar-check" title="Visual Indicators" defaultOpen>
    When browsing dates on your form, customers will see visual indicators of your availability:

    - **Available dates**: Dates when you have capacity for new bookings
    - **Limited availability**: Dates when you're approaching capacity or have blocked dates
    
    <Frame>
      ![Availability calendar view](/images/calendar.webp)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="message-dots" title="Status Messages" defaultOpen>
    After selecting a date, customers see clear availability messages:
    
    <Frame>
      ![Availability messages](/images/availability-messages.webp)
    </Frame>
    
    <Note>
      Even when dates show limited availability, customers can still submit requests, but they'll do so understanding they might need flexibility.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Availability Factors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="calendar-xmark" title="Blocked Dates" defaultOpen>
    If you've marked a date as blocked, it will automatically show as unavailable to customers.
    
    Use blocked dates for:
    - Company holidays
    - Days you know you can't service events
    - Maintenance periods
    - Personal time off
    
    <Info>
      To manage blocked dates, use the [Calendar](/calendar) feature to mark dates as unavailable.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="boxes-stacked" title="Resource Capacity" defaultOpen>
    The system determines availability by analyzing:
    - How many total resources you have available
    - How many resources are already committed to other events on that date
    
    **Example scenarios:**
    - If you have 4 carts total, and 2 are already booked for a date, that date will show as available (green)
    - If all 4 carts are booked, the date will show as limited availability (yellow)
    
    <Tip>
      You can adjust your resource capacity in the [Resources](/resources) section to ensure your availability is accurately displayed.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Multiple Locations" defaultOpen>
    If your business operates in multiple locations:
    
    - You can set different resources for each location
    - Availability will display based on the specific location's capacity
    - Customers will see availability specific to their selected location
    
    <Warning>
      Make sure to properly assign resources to each location in your [Settings](/settings) to ensure accurate availability display.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Setting Up For Success

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update Your Resources">
    Make sure your total available resources reflect your actual capacity. If you hire more staff or add equipment, update your [resources](/resources) accordingly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Maintain Your Calendar">
    Keep your calendar up-to-date by:
    - Blocking off dates when you know you won't be available
    - Ensuring events have the correct number of resources assigned
    - Regularly reviewing your upcoming bookings

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Your Availability">
    Periodically check how your availability appears to customers:
    - Test your form to see availability displays
    - Verify blocked dates are showing correctly
    - Ensure resource allocations are accurate
  </Step>
</Steps>
