Perfect for Instagram link-in-bio since Instagram doesn't allow clickable links in posts.

## Creating a Share Link

1. Go to **Forms** and select your form
2. Click the **Publish** tab
3. Customize your landing page settings
4. Copy your share link or QR code

Your form is now live at a `/f/{slug}` URL ready to share.

## Customization Options

### Landing Page Content

**Headline**: The main title visitors see when they arrive
- Keep it benefit-focused ("Get Your Custom Quote")
- Under 60 characters for best display

**Subheadline**: Supporting text under your headline
- Explain what happens next
- Build trust and set expectations
- Example: "Tell us about your event and we'll send you a personalized quote within 24 hours"

### Company Branding

Your hosted page automatically includes:

## Instagram Link-in-Bio

Instagram users can only include one clickable link in their bio. Use your share link to:

2. Post about your services with "Link in bio for quotes"
3. Drive followers directly to your quote form
4. Convert Instagram engagement into bookings

<Tip>
Update your Instagram bio text to include a call-to-action like "Get your event quote ↗️" to draw attention to the link.

3. Customers scan to access your quote form instantly
