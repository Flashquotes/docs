## Overview

Many CRMs and SMS automation tools require explicit consent before sending text messages. Flashquotes helps you capture that consent during lead intake, keeping you compliant while expanding your communication channels.

Capture SMS opt-in consent from leads during form submission. This feature adds a checkbox to your Contact Details page asking "Can we text you?" with customizable consent language.

## Setup

1. Go to your lead intake form editor
2. Select the Contact Details page
3. Expand "SMS Opt-in" in the settings panel
4. Toggle "Enable SMS opt-in"

The checkbox appears automatically on forms with phone number fields. Customize the question title and consent text to match your brand.

## Lead Management

Leads who opt in display a green "SMS" badge next to their phone number. This makes it easy to identify contacts who can receive text messages.
