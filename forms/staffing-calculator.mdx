## Overview

The Staffing Calculator automatically calculates and displays the number of staff members needed based on guest count and service duration. This helps set customer expectations and justify pricing.

## Configuration Options

### Service Length
- **Minimum Hours**: Set the shortest service duration you offer
- **Maximum Hours**: Set the longest service duration available
- Supports half-hour increments for flexibility

### Guest Count Controls
- **Increment Value**: Set how much the +/- buttons change the count (1-100)
- Smaller increments (5-10) work well for intimate gatherings
- Larger increments (25-50) are better for corporate events

### Staffing Ratios
- **Service Capacity**: Define how many drinks/services one staff member can handle per hour
- **Maximum Staff**: Optionally cap the number of staff shown (leave empty for unlimited)

## Display Modes

### Visual Counter (Recommended)
Shows an interactive display with staff member icons that adjust based on selections:
- Customize staff titles (e.g., "barista" / "baristas")
- Add descriptive text (e.g., "Serving lattes, cappuccinos, and more")
- Upload custom staff photos for a personal touch

### Text-Only Mode
For a simpler appearance, disable the visual counter:
- Displays only the form question without graphics
- Customize the question title and subtitle
- Calculations still happen behind the scenes
