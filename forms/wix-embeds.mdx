## Overview

Wix has technical constraints that affect how embedded forms display, especially on mobile devices. This guide covers best practices for embedding Flashquotes forms on Wix sites and solutions to common issues.

<Warning>
Wix enforces a 320px width limit on mobile iframes and uses sandboxed rendering that can break responsive design. Test your embed on mobile before going live.
</Warning>

## Known Wix Limitations

### Mobile Display Issues

Wix's mobile rendering differs from other website builders:

- **320px width constraint**: All mobile content displays at 320px width regardless of device capabilities
- **Non-responsive preview**: Chrome Developer Tools cannot accurately preview Wix mobile layouts
- **Sandboxed iframes**: Wix wraps embeds in an additional iframe that prevents natural responsive behavior
- **Fixed height containers**: Dynamic height adjustments may not work as expected

### What This Means for Your Forms

- Multi-step forms may appear cramped on mobile
- Form fields might not scale properly
- Scrolling within the iframe may be required
- Dynamic height changes between form steps may not function

## Recommended Approach: Mobile Button Alternative

For the best user experience, use a hybrid approach:

### Desktop: Full Embed
Embed your Flashquotes form normally for desktop users where space isn't constrained.

### Mobile: Link to Hosted Form
Replace the iframe with a button that links to your form's Share Link.

**Implementation steps:**
1. Generate a [Share Link](/forms/share-links) in your Flashquotes dashboard
2. In Wix's mobile editor, [hide the HTML iframe element](https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-mobile-apps-showing-or-hiding-elements-on-different-mobile-operating-systems)
3. Add a button with text like "Get Custom Pricing" or "Request Quote"
4. Link the button to your Share Link URL

This ensures mobile users get the full, responsive form experience without Wix's constraints.

## If You Choose to Embed on Mobile

If you prefer to keep the iframe embed on mobile, follow these optimization steps:

- Ensure the embed code is wrapped in a div with at least 320px width and 650px height
- Test the embed on actual mobile devices, not just Wix's mobile preview

## Next Steps

After setting up your Wix embed:
