## Overview

The Inbox feature provides a centralized view of all your Gmail messages related to leads, allowing you to manage customer communications without leaving Flashquotes. Emails are synced from your connected Gmail accounts and organized into threads for easy navigation.

<Note>
The Inbox feature requires a [Plus or Pro subscription](https://flashquotes.com/pricing) and a connected Gmail account with appropriate permissions.

## Understanding Email Sync

### What Gets Synced

The inbox syncs emails that:
- Are in your Gmail inbox
- Are associated with known leads (matched by email address)
- Come from Gmail accounts you've connected to Flashquotes

### Email Matching

Emails are automatically matched to leads when:
- The sender's email address matches a lead in your system
- The conversation includes emails from known lead contacts

## Tips and Best Practices

- Handled threads disappear, keeping focus on what needs attention
- Emails remain in Gmail for reference and searching

### Multi-Account Management

- Connect multiple Gmail accounts if you use different addresses for different services
- Filter by account to focus on specific business lines
- All emails remain unified in one interface

### Lead Context

- Hover over lead names to quickly see quote history and booking status
- Click through to the lead profile for detailed conversations
- Use lead context to craft better follow-up responses

## Troubleshooting
