## Payment Processing

### Payment Breakdown

The invoice view displays a detailed breakdown of all payments made toward the invoice:

- **Payment history**: Each payment shows the date, method, and amount paid
- **Card details**: Stripe payments display the card brand and last 4 digits (e.g., Visa •••• 4242)
- **Payment status**: Clearly distinguishes between pending and completed payments
- **Receipt links**: Payments made through Stripe include a clickable receipt link — click the payment amount to view the Stripe receipt
- **Refunds**: Refunded amounts appear in the breakdown with negative values

<Tip>
  The payment breakdown is also included when customers download or print the invoice PDF, making it easy for them to maintain records.
