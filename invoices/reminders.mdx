## Overview

Invoice reminders help ensure timely payments from your clients. Flashquotes offers both automated reminder emails and manual reminder options, giving you flexibility in how you follow up on unpaid invoices.

## Customer Payment Access

Every invoice in Flashquotes includes a dedicated payment link that is available to customers on their confirmation page. This makes it easy for customers to access and pay their invoices at any time.

## Automated Reminder Emails

### Enabling Automated Reminders

To set up automated invoice reminders:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Invoices**
2. Find the **Automatic invoice reminders** toggle
3. Switch the toggle to **On**

<Note>
  Automated email reminders only apply to new invoices created after enabling
  this feature. Turning off automatic reminders removes them from all invoices.
</Note>

### Default Reminder Schedule

When enabled, Flashquotes will automatically send reminder emails based on the following schedule:

| Reminder   | Timing                |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Reminder 1 | 1 day before due date |
| Reminder 2 | On the due date       |
| Reminder 3 | 2 days after due date |

### Preview Reminder Emails

You can preview how each reminder email will appear to customers:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Invoices**
2. Find the reminder you want to review
3. Click the **Preview email** button

This allows you to ensure your automated reminders maintain the appropriate tone and messaging for your business.

## Manual Invoice Reminders

In addition to automated reminders, you can send one-off reminders for any invoice:

1. Go to the **Invoices** page in Flashquotes
2. Select the specific invoice you want to remind about
3. Click the **Send Invoice** button
4. A preview modal will appear showing the reminder email
5. Customize the email subject if needed
6. Click **Send** to deliver the reminder to your customer

<Tip>
  Manual reminders are particularly useful for following up on overdue invoices
  that require special attention, or for invoices created before you enabled
  automated reminders.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- **Enable automated reminders** for a consistent follow-up process
- **Review reminder preview emails** to ensure they match your company's tone
- **Use manual reminders** for special circumstances or older invoices
- **Monitor invoice status** regularly to identify any payment issues
- **Combine with clear payment terms** set in your initial invoice
