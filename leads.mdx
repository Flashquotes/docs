## Frequently Asked Questions About Quote Expiration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="question-circle" title="Can customers book expired quotes?">
    No. When a quote expires, customers cannot proceed with booking. They'll see a message explaining the quote has expired with options to:
    - Request a new quote with current pricing
    - Contact your company directly to discuss

    This ensures all bookings use current pricing and availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="calendar-plus" title="How do I extend a quote that's about to expire?">
    You can change expiration dates from three locations:
    - **Lead Details Page** - Click on the lead and edit the quote
    - **Quote Edit Page** - Modify the expiration field while editing
    - **Quote View Page** - Quick edit the expiration date

    Simply change the date to a future date to keep the quote active.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="refresh" title="Can I reactivate an expired quote?">
    Yes! To reactivate an expired quote:
    1. Navigate to the quote (from leads, quote edit, or quote view)
    2. Change the expiration date to a future date
    3. The quote becomes immediately bookable again

    Consider whether the pricing is still current before reactivating old quotes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Why can't customers book expired quotes?">
    This protection ensures:
    - Customers receive accurate, current pricing
    - Availability is verified before booking
    - Your business isn't locked into outdated rates
    - Service offerings and packages remain current
    - Reduces pricing disputes and confusion

    It's a safeguard for both you and your customers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="What's the best expiration period for quotes?">
    Most businesses find 7-14 days optimal because it:
    - Creates urgency without rushing decisions
    - Allows time for customer consideration
    - Keeps pricing relevant to current costs
    - Encourages timely follow-up

    Configure your default in [quote settings](/settings/quotes).
  </Accordion>
