# Flashquotes AutoDraft

Save time with Flashquotes AutoDraft - automatically pre-build draft quotes from your leads. Instead of starting from scratch, you'll review and send pre-built quotes in seconds.

This works for manual quoting (not instant quotes). Perfect when you want consistent pricing but need to review each quote before sending.

## Set up AutoDraft

### 1. Create your default service
Go to Settings > Add-Ons and create your primary service offering. Set your base pricing and service details. This becomes the foundation for every AutoDraft quote.
[Learn about add-ons and services →](/settings/add-ons)

### 2. Add your common add-ons
In the same section, create add-ons for extras you frequently offer (delivery, setup, additional hours). Set pricing for each.
[Configure add-ons →](/settings/add-ons)

### 3. Configure your quote form
In Settings > Quote Forms, edit your form and select your default service in the "Default Service" dropdown. Save the form.
[Set up lead intake forms →](/forms/lead-intake)

## What happens next
When new leads come in through this form, AutoDraft creates a draft quote with your default service. You can add/remove services, adjust pricing, then send.

## Troubleshooting AutoDraft
- **No draft quotes appearing**: Check that you selected a default service in your quote form settings
- **Wrong pricing showing**: Verify your default service has current pricing set
- **Missing add-ons**: Add-ons aren't auto-applied - add them to individual quotes as needed
