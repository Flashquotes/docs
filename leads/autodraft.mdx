# Flashquotes AutoDraft

Save time with Flashquotes AutoDraft - automatically pre-build draft quotes from your leads. Instead of starting from scratch, you'll review and send pre-built quotes in seconds.

This works for manual quoting (not instant quotes). Perfect when you want consistent pricing but need to review each quote before sending.

## Set up AutoDraft

### 1. Create your default service
Go to [Services](https://app.flashquotes.com/services) and create your primary service offering. Set your base pricing and service details. This becomes the foundation for every AutoDraft quote.
[Learn about services →](/services)

### 2. Add your common add-ons
Navigate to [Add-Ons](https://app.flashquotes.com/addons) to create extras you frequently offer (delivery, setup, additional hours). Set pricing for each.
[Configure add-ons →](/services/add-ons)

### 3. Configure your form's default service
Open your lead intake form and click the "Instant Pricing" button. In the pricing settings modal, select your default service in the "Fallback Service" dropdown. This service will be used for all AutoDraft quotes from this form.
[Set up lead intake forms →](/forms/lead-intake)

## What happens next
When new leads come in through this form, AutoDraft creates a draft quote with your default service. You can add/remove services, adjust pricing, then send.

## Troubleshooting AutoDraft
- **No draft quotes appearing**: Check that you selected a fallback service in your form's instant pricing settings
- **Wrong pricing showing**: Verify your selected service has current pricing configured
- **Missing add-ons**: Add-ons aren't auto-applied - add them to individual quotes as needed
