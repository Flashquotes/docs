## Overview

The Booking Flow controls how customers complete their booking after accepting your quote. Configure which booking form collects customer information and which payment terms apply directly from the quote editor.

## How It Works

The booking flow consists of three steps:

1. **Booking Form** - The form customers complete when booking (required)
2. **Contract** - Digital contract signing *(coming soon)*
3. **Payment Terms** - How and when payments are collected

## Payment Terms

Payment terms define your payment schedule for each quote. Select from your configured options or create new terms directly from the quote editor.

### Selecting payment terms

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Booking Flow section">
    Scroll to the **Booking Flow** section in the quote editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select payment terms">
    Click the Payment Terms dropdown to choose from your configured options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new terms (optional)">
    Click **Add new payment terms** to create custom terms directly from the quote editor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payment Schedule Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-dollar-to-slot" title="Full Payment">
    **Best for:** Events that require complete payment upfront

    **How it works:**
    - Clients pay 100% of the quote total when booking
    - No additional payments needed

    **Configuration options:**
    - No additional configuration needed
    - Clients will be charged the full quote amount at booking
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Deposit + Balance">
    **Best for:** Events that require an upfront deposit to secure the booking

    **How it works:**
    - Clients pay a deposit amount when booking
    - Remaining balance is invoiced and due before the event

    **Configuration options:**
    - **Deposit Type:** Choose between:
      - **Fixed Amount:** Set a specific dollar amount (e.g., $500)
      - **Percentage:** Set a percentage of the total quote (e.g., 25%)
    - **Deposit Amount:** Enter the fixed dollar amount or percentage value
    - **Balance Due:** Set when the remaining balance is due (days before/after event)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-invoice" title="Invoice Only">
    **Best for:** Corporate clients or situations where payment is handled through traditional invoicing

    **How it works:**
    - No payment collected through Flashquotes at booking
    - Booking is confirmed without payment
    - Invoice is generated and sent to the client

    **Configuration options:**
    - **Invoice Due:** Set when payment is due (days before/after event)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="Card on File">
    **Best for:** Events where you want to authorize a card for later charges

    **How it works:**
    - Client's card is authorized but not charged at booking
    - Card is charged by you when you're ready to collect payment
    - Invoice is generated with the payment due date

    **Configuration options:**
    - **Invoice Due:** Set when payment is due (days before/after event)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Editing Payment Terms

Click the **Edit** button next to any payment terms option to modify:

  </Card>

  <Card title="Private Events" icon="party-horn">
    25-50% deposit required upfront
  </Card>

    Full payment upfront
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Scenarios
