## Overview

Instant Pricing and Quoting automatically calculates service quotes based on predefined pricing rules, saving time and ensuring consistent pricing across your lead intake forms. With Instant Quoting enabled, clients can receive and book quotes immediately upon form submission.

## Setting Up Service Pricing

### Step 1: Create or Edit a Service

Navigate to the Services tab and either create a new service or edit an existing one. In the service editor, you'll find the Pricing Configuration section with the following options:

    alt="Pricing Configuration UI showing fields for Base Price, Hourly Rate Per Staff, Price Per Guest, and Minimum Price"
  />
</Frame>

- **Base Price**: Starting price for the service before any adjustments
- **Hourly Rate Per Staff**: Rate charged per staff member per hour
- **Price Per Guest**: Additional charge per guest (optional)
- **Minimum Price**: The lowest price that will ever be quoted for this service

<Note>
  The Minimum Price threshold ensures you never quote below your cost basis,
  protecting your business's profitability.
</Note>

### Example Calculation

For an event with:

- 2 staff members
- 3 hours duration
- 50 guests

The total price would be calculated as:

```
Total = Base Price + (Hourly Rate × Staff × Hours) + (Price Per Guest × Guests)
```

<Tip>
  If the calculated total is less than the Minimum Price, the system will
  automatically use the Minimum Price instead.
</Tip>

## Setting Default Pricing Rules

### Step 1: Access Pricing Settings

1. Go to your lead intake form's edit page
2. Click the "Instant Pricing" button in the header navigation
3. The pricing settings modal will open

</Frame>

### Step 2: Configure Quoting Mode

When configuring your lead intake form's pricing settings, you'll find two quoting modes:

- **Manual Quoting** (Default): Generates a draft quote for admin review before sending
- **Instant Quoting**: Automatically calculates and presents quotes to clients immediately upon form submission

<Note>
  Instant Quoting is available exclusively on the FlashQuotes Pro plan.
</Note>

### Step 3: Select Default Service

Choose a service to use as the default pricing rule set for the form. When leads submit this form, the pricing will be calculated in one of two ways:

1. **With Service Selection Question**: If your lead intake form includes a service selection question, the system will use the pricing rules from the service(s) that the customer selected in the form.

2. **Without Service Selection Question**: If your form doesn't include service selection, the system will use the pricing rules from the default service you configure here.

<Warning>
  Make sure to test your pricing configurations with different combinations of
  staff, hours, and guest counts before enabling Instant Quoting. If using a
  service selection question, test with each available service option.
</Warning>

## How It Works

When Instant Quoting is enabled:

1. Client submits your lead intake form
2. System determines which service pricing rules to use:
   - If the form has a service selection question: Uses the selected service's rules
   - If no service selection: Uses the default service's rules
3. Calculates the price based on:
   - Number of staff requested
   - Event duration
   - Guest count
4. Automatically redirects the client to a quote presentation page
5. Client can review the quote and click "Book Now" immediately

<Tip>
  Instant Quoting creates a seamless experience where clients can inquire,
  receive a quote, and book all in one visit to your website.
