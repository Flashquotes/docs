## Overview

Instant Pricing automatically calculates service quotes based on predefined pricing rules, saving time and ensuring consistent pricing across your lead intake forms.

## Setting Up Service Pricing

### Step 1: Create or Edit a Service

Navigate to the Services tab and either create a new service or edit an existing one. In the service editor, you'll find the Pricing Configuration section with the following options:

    alt="Pricing Configuration UI showing fields for Base Price, Hourly Rate Per Staff, Price Per Guest, and Minimum Price"
  />
</Frame>

- **Base Price**: Starting price for the service before any adjustments
- **Hourly Rate Per Staff**: Rate charged per staff member per hour
- **Price Per Guest**: Additional charge per guest (optional)
- **Minimum Price**: The lowest price that will ever be quoted for this service

<Note>
  The Minimum Price threshold ensures you never quote below your cost basis,
  protecting your business's profitability.
</Note>

### Example Calculation

For an event with:

- 2 staff members
- 3 hours duration
- 50 guests

The total price would be calculated as:

```
Total = Base Price + (Hourly Rate × Staff × Hours) + (Price Per Guest × Guests)
```

<Tip>
  If the calculated total is less than the Minimum Price, the system will
  automatically use the Minimum Price instead.
</Tip>

## Setting Default Pricing Rules

### Step 1: Access Pricing Settings

1. Go to your lead intake form's edit page
2. Click the "Instant Pricing" button in the header navigation
3. The pricing settings modal will open

  />
</Frame>

### Step 2: Select Default Service

Choose a service to use as the default pricing rule set for the form. When leads submit this form, the pricing will automatically be calculated using the selected service's configuration.

<Warning>
  Make sure to test your pricing configurations with different combinations of
  staff, hours, and guest counts before publishing your forms.
</Warning>

## How It Works

When a new lead submits your intake form:

1. The system uses the form's default service pricing rules
2. Calculates the price based on:
   - Number of staff requested
   - Event duration
   - Guest count
3. Creates a draft quote with the calculated price
4. Admins can review and adjust the price before sending the quote

## Important Notes

<Note>
  - Instant Pricing generates draft quotes only - you can still review and
  adjust prices before sending to clients - The system calculates separate
  prices for multi-day events based on the duration and guest count for each day
  - You can update pricing configurations at any time without affecting existing
  quotes
</Note>

## Next Steps

After setting up Instant Pricing:

- [Test your forms](/forms/booking) with sample submissions
- [Review generated quotes](/leads/quotes) to ensure accuracy
- [Send quotes to clients](/leads/sending-quotes) after review
