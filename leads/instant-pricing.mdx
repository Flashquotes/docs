## Setting Up Service Pricing

### Step 1: Create or Edit a Service

Navigate to the Services tab and either create a new service or edit an existing one. In the service editor, you'll find the Pricing Configuration section with the following options:

  />
</Frame>

- **Base Price**: Starting price for the service before any adjustments
- **Hourly Rate Per Staff**: Rate charged per staff member per hour
- **Price Per Guest**: Additional charge per guest (optional)
- **Minimum Price**: The lowest price that will ever be quoted for this service

<Note>
  The Minimum Price threshold ensures you never quote below your cost basis,
  protecting your business's profitability.
</Note>

### Example Calculation

For an event with:

- 2 staff members
- 3 hours duration
- 50 guests

The total price would be calculated as:

```
Total = Base Price + (Hourly Rate × Staff × Hours) + (Price Per Guest × Guests)
```

<Tip>
  If the calculated total is less than the Minimum Price, the system will
  automatically use the Minimum Price instead.
</Tip>

## Setting Default Pricing Rules

### Step 1: Access Pricing Settings

1. Go to your lead intake form's edit page
2. Click the "Instant Pricing" button in the header navigation
3. The pricing settings modal will open

### Step 2: Configure Quoting Mode

When configuring your lead intake form's pricing settings, you'll find two quoting modes:

- **Manual Quoting** (Default): Generates a draft quote for admin review before sending
- **Instant Quoting**: Automatically calculates and presents quotes to clients immediately upon form submission

<Note>
  Instant Quoting is available exclusively on the [FlashQuotes Pro
  plan](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/plans).
</Note>

### Step 3: Choose Your Pricing Approach

There are two ways pricing works with forms, depending on whether you have a service selection question:

#### Forms WITH Service Selection Questions

When your form includes a service selection question:

- Pricing comes from the service the customer selects
- Works for both manual and instant quoting
- The "fallback service" configured below is only used if no service is selected
- Each service can have different pricing rules

#### Forms WITHOUT Service Selection Questions

When your form doesn't include service selection:

- All quotes use the single service configured in pricing settings
- This creates "fixed pricing" where every quote follows the same pricing rules
- Simpler setup for single-service businesses

<Tip>
  Not sure which approach to use? Single service businesses often prefer fixed pricing, while multi-service businesses benefit from service selection questions.
</Tip>

### Step 4: Configure Fallback Service

Select a service to use when:
- Forms with service selection have no service selected
- Forms without service selection questions (this becomes your fixed pricing service)

<Warning>
  Make sure to test your pricing configurations with different combinations of
  staff, hours, and guest counts before enabling Instant Quoting. If using a
  service selection question, test with each available service option.
</Warning>

## How It Works

When Instant Quoting is enabled:

1. **Client submits your lead intake form**
2. **System determines pricing source:**
   - **With service selection question**: Uses the service the customer selected
   - **Without service selection question**: Uses the fallback service configured in settings
   - **No service selected**: Falls back to the configured default service
3. **Calculates the price using the selected service's pricing rules:**
   - Base price + (Hourly rate × Staff × Hours) + (Price per guest × Guests)
   - Applies minimum price threshold if calculated total is lower
4. **Automatically redirects client to quote presentation page**
5. **Client can review the quote and click "Book Now" immediately**

<Note>
  The pricing calculation is identical for manual and instant quoting - the only difference is when the quote gets presented to the customer.
</Note>

<Tip>
  Instant Quoting creates a seamless experience where clients can inquire,
  receive a quote, and book all in one visit to your website.
