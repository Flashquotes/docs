        alt="Step-by-step demonstration of changing quote expiration dates from the lead details page"
      />
    </Frame>

    ### Where to Change Expiration Dates

    You can modify quote expiration from three locations:
    - **Lead Details Page**: Click on the lead, then edit the quote expiration
    - **Quote Edit Page**: When editing a quote, update the expiration field
    - **Quote View Page**: View the quote and click to modify expiration

    ### Common Scenarios

    **Extending About-to-Expire Quotes:**
    - If a client needs more time to decide, extend the expiration by a few days
    - This prevents the quote from expiring while negotiations are ongoing

    **Reactivating Expired Quotes:**
    - Change the expiration date to a future date to reactivate an expired quote
    - The quote becomes bookable again immediately

    **Removing Expiration:**
    - For special clients or situations, you can remove the expiration entirely
    - The quote will remain bookable indefinitely

    <Tip>
      Monitor quotes approaching expiration and proactively extend them if you're still in conversation with the lead.
    </Tip>

    <Warning>
      Remember that expired quotes cannot be booked by customers. They'll see a message prompting them to request a new quote or contact you directly.
