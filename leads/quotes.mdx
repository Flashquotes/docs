## Getting the Most from Your Quotes

### Best Practices for All Quote Types

1. **Review all pre-populated information for accuracy**
2. **Keep pricing and terms clear and consistent**
3. **Use appropriate hero images and messaging**
4. **Add additional travel costs and mileage as necessary using the map integration**
5. **Verify all details before sending**

### Location and Travel Planning

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="map" title="Map Integration">
    Each quote includes an integrated map view showing:
    
    - Service location
    - Venue address
    - Drive time
    - Mileage calculation

    This helps ensure accurate travel cost estimation and proper profit margins.
