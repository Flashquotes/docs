## Getting the Most from Your Quotes

### Best Practices for All Quote Types

1. **Review all pre-populated information for accuracy**
2. **Keep pricing and terms clear and consistent**
3. **Use appropriate hero images and messaging**
4. **Add additional travel costs and mileage as necessary using the map integration**
5. **Verify all details before sending**

### Add-on Quantity Management

When working with add-ons and services:
- Add-on quantities automatically respect any min/max limits set in your add-on configuration
- The system enforces quantity constraints when creating or editing quotes
- Customers can adjust quantities on their quote page within configured limits

### Location and Travel Planning

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="map" title="Map Integration">
    Each quote includes an integrated map view showing:
    
    - Service location
    - Venue address
    - Drive time
    - Mileage calculation

    This helps ensure accurate travel cost estimation and proper profit margins.

## Service Days

Service days let you attach multiple dates and times to a single quote. Perfect for multi-day events, setups, or separate service blocks.

<Info>
  When a quote is booked, each service day becomes its own event inside the
  booking.
</Info>

<Frame>

    alt="Service Days editor interface showing multiple service days with date and time inputs"
  />
</Frame>

### How service days work

- **Per-quote**: Add as many service days as needed
- **Separate events**: Each service day converts to an individual event upon booking
- **Inline editing**: Edit date and time directly in the quote editor
- **Timezone aware**: All times handled in your location's timezone

### Adding or editing service days
