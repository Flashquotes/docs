## Best Practices

1. Review quote details before sharing
2. Ensure the correct booking form is selected before sending
3. Follow up with leads as needed
4. Track quote status regularly
5. Monitor for client engagement

## Next Steps

After sending a quote:

- Follow up with leads as needed
- [Review bookings](/bookings) when your quote is booked

## Handling Expired Quotes

When quotes reach their expiration date, they become unbookable to ensure pricing and availability remain current.

### What Happens When Quotes Expire

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="ban" title="Customer Experience">
    When customers view an expired quote, they:
    - See a clear message that the quote has expired
    - Cannot proceed with booking
    - Are presented with two options:
      1. **Request a New Quote** - Starts a fresh conversation with updated pricing
      2. **Contact Company** - Reach out directly to discuss options

    This ensures customers always receive current pricing and availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Business Protection">
    The expired quote prevention feature protects your business by:
    - Preventing bookings with outdated pricing
    - Ensuring availability is verified before booking
    - Avoiding conflicts with pricing changes or discontinued services
    - Reducing disputes over old rates
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="edit" title="Extending Expiration Dates">
    Admins can modify expiration dates at any time from:
    - **Lead Details Page** - Edit directly from the lead view
    - **Quote Edit Page** - Change while editing quote details
    - **Quote View Page** - Quick edit from the quote preview

    You can:
    - Extend quotes that are about to expire
    - Reactivate expired quotes by setting a future date
    - Remove expiration entirely for special cases
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Best Practices for Quote Expiration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Approaching Expirations">
    Check your leads dashboard regularly for quotes nearing expiration. Proactively extend them if you're still in conversation with the lead.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Follow Up Before Expiration">
    Send a reminder email 2-3 days before expiration to create urgency and offer to answer any questions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reactivate When Needed">
    If a lead re-engages after expiration, simply extend the expiration date to make the quote bookable again.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Fresh Quotes When Appropriate">
    For significantly expired quotes (30+ days), consider creating a new quote with updated pricing rather than extending the old one.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Set your default expiration period in [quote settings](/settings/quotes) to balance urgency with giving clients adequate decision time. Most companies find 7-14 days optimal.
</Tip>

## Tracking Quote Performance

Our analytics tools help you understand how leads interact with your quotes, giving you valuable insights into engagement and helping you time your follow-ups perfectly.

### Understanding Quote Analytics

The system tracks three key engagement metrics for your quotes:

1. **Email Opened**  
   Track how many times your quote emails have been opened. Each email open indicates potential interest from your lead.

2. **Quote Viewed**  
   See how many times someone has clicked through to view your quote presentation page online. This metric helps you understand if leads are taking the time to review your detailed proposal.

3. **Book Now Clicked**  
   Monitor how many times leads have clicked the "Book Now" button. This is a strong indicator of intent to book your services.

### Where to Find Analytics

You can find these metrics in two main places:

#### Lead Index & Lead Detail Pages

Look for colored badge pills next to your leads showing:

- Email open count
- Quote view count
- "Book Now" button click count

These quick indicators help you identify your most engaged leads at a glance.

#### Quote Detail Page

For a more comprehensive view, visit the Quote Detail page to see all engagement metrics in one place. This detailed view helps you understand the full journey of how leads are interacting with your quotes.

### Using Analytics Effectively

- **Time Your Follow-ups**: High engagement (multiple email opens or quote views) might indicate a lead is actively considering your services—a perfect time for follow-up.
- **Identify Hot Leads**: Leads who have clicked the "Book Now" button are showing strong intent and should be prioritized.
- **Track Response Patterns**: Understanding when leads typically view quotes can help you optimize when to send them.
