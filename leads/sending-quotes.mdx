## Tracking Quote Performance

Our analytics tools help you understand how leads interact with your quotes, giving you valuable insights into engagement and helping you time your follow-ups perfectly.

### Understanding Quote Analytics

The system tracks three key engagement metrics for your quotes:

1. **Email Opened**  
   Track how many times your quote emails have been opened. Each email open indicates potential interest from your lead.

2. **Quote Viewed**  
   See how many times someone has clicked through to view your quote presentation page online. This metric helps you understand if leads are taking the time to review your detailed proposal.

3. **Book Now Clicked**  
   Monitor how many times leads have clicked the "Book Now" button. This is a strong indicator of intent to book your services.

### Where to Find Analytics

You can find these metrics in two main places:

#### Lead Index & Lead Detail Pages

Look for colored badge pills next to your leads showing:

- Email open count
- Quote view count
- "Book Now" button click count

These quick indicators help you identify your most engaged leads at a glance.

#### Quote Detail Page

For a more comprehensive view, visit the Quote Detail page to see all engagement metrics in one place. This detailed view helps you understand the full journey of how leads are interacting with your quotes.

### Using Analytics Effectively

- **Time Your Follow-ups**: High engagement (multiple email opens or quote views) might indicate a lead is actively considering your services—a perfect time for follow-up.
- **Identify Hot Leads**: Leads who have clicked the "Book Now" button are showing strong intent and should be prioritized.
- **Track Response Patterns**: Understanding when leads typically view quotes can help you optimize when to send them.
