## Overview

Service days let you build multi-day quotes with different dates and times per day. Perfect for wedding weekends, corporate events, and festivals.

<Info>
  Each service day becomes a separate event when the quote is booked.
</Info>

## How It Works

1. **Add service days** to your quote with different dates/times
2. **Client books** - each service day becomes an event
3. **Manage events** separately while keeping them under one booking
