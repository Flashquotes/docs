## ✅ Task Templates

Task templates are a powerful way to ensure your admin and event team are completing specific tasks for every event you book. This helps ensure your team doesn’t miss a beat in delivering a great event.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion icon="square-check" title="Add Admin Task Templates">
    In [Task Settings](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/tasks), you can setup your Admin Task Templates. These tasks will be added to the Overview section of each event and will be clearly presented in the [Events](https://app.flashquotes.com/events) section. You can also include a Default Due Date for each task, to ensure they’re completed timely.

    <Tip>
    Have an event that requires a unique task? Just add or edit admin tasks in the Overview section of the event.
    </Tip>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="square-check" title="Add Event Brief Task Templates">
    In [Task Settings](https://app.flashquotes.com/settings/tasks), you can setup your Event Brief Task Templates. These tasks will be added to the Event brief section of each event and, most importantly, will be presented in the public event brief document to share with your event team.

Each task can be put in a specific order and assigned to a section of the event brief (e.g. “Prep & Loading” or “Service”). This way, your event team can reference the event brief throughout working the event to make sure all tasks are complete.

<Tip>
	Have an event that requires a unique task? Just add or edit event brief tasks
	in the Event brief section of your event.
</Tip>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="markdown" title="Use Markdown in Tasks">
    You can add specific styling or hyperlinks in your tasks using standard [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This allows you to format text in a way that best suits your needs.

    Here are some common Markdown styles to get you started:

    - Surround text with two asterisks `**` to **bold** it.
      - Example: `**This** is bold` results in "**This** is bold".
    - Surround text with one asterisk `*` to *italicize* it.
      - Example: `*This* is italicized` results in "*This* is italicized".
    - Surround text in brackets `[]` followed by a URL in parentheses `()` to create a hyperlink.
      - Example: `Take me to [Google](https://google.com)` results in "Take me to [Google](https://google.com)".

    Use these Markdown tips to make your task titles clear, engaging, and useful.
