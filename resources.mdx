## Overview

  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Editing Resources">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Availability Tracking

Resources are tracked for availability based on event assignments:

- **Available status**: The resource can be assigned to new events
- **Unavailable status**: The resource is out of service and won't appear as an option for event assignment
- **Event conflicts**: When assigning resources to events, the system shows which resources are already booked for that date

<Info>
Core service assets are used to calculate availability shown on booking forms. If you need accurate availability tracking, make sure to add your core resources.
</Info>

## Assigning Resources to Events

Resources can be assigned to events from the event detail page. When selecting resources:
- Only resources marked as "Available" are shown
- Resources already booked on that date are hidden to prevent double-booking
- Resources are filtered by the event's location

<Tip>
Assign resources to every event to keep your availability accurate and avoid overbooking.
</Tip>

## Utilization Reporting

Monitor your core service asset utilization on the [Reports](/reports#service-asset-utilization) page:
- View daily utilization across a date range
- See booked vs quoted capacity
- Identify your busiest days
- Track average daily utilization

## Best Practices

1. **Add all core service assets** to enable accurate availability tracking
2. **Keep status current** - mark resources as unavailable when they're out of service
3. **Upload photos** to help with quick identification
4. **Assign resources to events** to maintain accurate utilization data
5. **Review the utilization report** to understand capacity and plan for busy periods

## Next Steps

After setting up resources:
- [Configure booking forms](/forms) to show availability
- [Create events](/events) and assign resources
- [Review utilization reports](/reports) to monitor capacity
