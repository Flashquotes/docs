## Overview

Services are the foundation of your Flashquotes business. Configure what you offer, how you price it, and what extras customers can add.

## Quick Setup

Set up your services in 3 steps:

1. **Define core services** - Your main offerings (bar service, photo booth, etc.)
2. **Configure pricing** - Per hour, flat rate, or custom pricing models
3. **Add extras** - Upsells and add-ons to increase booking value

## Service Management

Navigate to your services and add-ons from the main navigation:
- **Services**: Go to Services in the main menu to manage your core offerings
- **Add-ons**: Go to Add-ons in the main menu to create extras and upsells

## How Services Work

**In quotes:** Customers see your services with clear pricing and descriptions. They can select add-ons and customize their package.

**In bookings:** Confirmed services transfer automatically to your calendar and event management system.

**In invoicing:** Service details flow through to invoices with accurate pricing and tax calculations.

## Getting Started

1. Start with your main service offering
2. Set clear pricing that covers your costs
3. Add 2-3 popular add-ons
4. Test with a sample quote

<Note>
  Services created here appear in quote generation and customer-facing forms. Make descriptions clear and pricing accurate.
