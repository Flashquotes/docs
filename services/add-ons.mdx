## Overview

Add-ons are extras and upsells that customers can add to their bookings. Navigate to **Add-ons** in the main menu to create and manage these additional services. Each add-on can be configured with specific pricing models and quantity limits.

<Tip>
  **Not sure if something should be a service or an add-on?** See [Structuring Your Services](/services/structuring-services) for guidance. In general, if a customer wouldn't book it on its own, it's an add-on.
</Tip>

**Common add-ons:**
- Extra hours of service
- Additional staff members
- Custom cups, sleeves, or branding
- Premium upgrades (syrups, milk options)
- Travel fees or special setup charges

## Add-on Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Creating Add-ons">
    Set up new add-ons with:
    - Display name
    - Description
    - Pricing structure
    - Quantity limits (for per unit pricing)
    - Add-on image

    ### Quantity Limits
    For "Per Unit" priced add-ons, set minimum and maximum quantity controls:

    - **Min Quantity**: Enforce minimum order requirements
    - **Max Quantity**: Prevent over-ordering or resource conflicts
    - **Default Quantity**: Uses minimum if set, otherwise defaults to 1

    **Examples**:
    - Cocktail tables: Min 2, Max 10 (event space limitations)
    - Bartenders: Min 1, Max 4 (staffing availability)
    - Photo booth props: Min 5, Max 25 (package deals)

    <Note>
      Quantity limits only apply to per-unit pricing. Flat rate and other pricing models don't use these controls.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="money-bill" title="Pricing Options">
    Configure pricing models:
    - **Flat rate**: Fixed price regardless of quantity
    - **Per unit**: Price multiplied by quantity ordered
    - **Per guest**: Price based on guest count
    - **Per hour**: Price based on service duration
    - **Per resource**: Price based on resources used
    - **Per unit per hour**: Combined unit and hourly pricing

    ### How Quantity Limits Work

    **Minimum Quantity**:
    - Prevents customers from ordering below your business requirements
    - Automatically sets as default quantity when customers add the item
    - Useful for items that require minimum orders to be profitable

    **Maximum Quantity**:
    - Prevents over-ordering beyond your capacity
    - Helps manage resource allocation and logistics
    - Protects against inventory shortages

    **Common Use Cases**:
    - Audio equipment: Min 1 speaker, Max 8 speakers (venue size limits)
    - Linens: Min 10 napkins, Max 200 napkins (bulk order efficiency)
    - Staff: Min 1 server, Max 6 servers (team size management)
