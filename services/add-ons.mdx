## Overview

Add-on settings allow you to create and manage additional services that can be included in quotes and bookings. Each add-on can be configured with specific pricing models and automation IDs for integration purposes.

## Add-on Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Creating Add-ons">
    Set up new add-ons with:
    - Unique identifier
    - Display name
    - Description
    - Pricing structure
    - Quantity limits (for per unit pricing)
    - Availability rules
    
    ### Quantity Limits
    For "Per Unit" priced add-ons, set minimum and maximum quantity controls:
    
    - **Min Quantity**: Enforce minimum order requirements
    - **Max Quantity**: Prevent over-ordering or resource conflicts
    - **Default Quantity**: Uses minimum if set, otherwise defaults to 1
    
    **Examples**:
    - Cocktail tables: Min 2, Max 10 (event space limitations)
    - Bartenders: Min 1, Max 4 (staffing availability)
    - Photo booth props: Min 5, Max 25 (package deals)
    
    <Note>
      Quantity limits only apply to per-unit pricing. Flat rate and other pricing models don't use these controls.
    </Note>
    
    <Note>
      Unique IDs are essential for automation workflows and integrations.

    ### How Quantity Limits Work
    
    **Minimum Quantity**:
    - Prevents customers from ordering below your business requirements
    - Automatically sets as default quantity when customers add the item
    - Useful for items that require minimum orders to be profitable
    
    **Maximum Quantity**:
    - Prevents over-ordering beyond your capacity
    - Helps manage resource allocation and logistics
    - Protects against inventory shortages
    
    **Common Use Cases**:
    - Audio equipment: Min 1 speaker, Max 8 speakers (venue size limits)
    - Linens: Min 10 napkins, Max 200 napkins (bulk order efficiency)
    - Staff: Min 1 server, Max 6 servers (team size management)
