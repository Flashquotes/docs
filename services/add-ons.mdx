## Overview

Add-ons are extras and upsells that customers can add to their bookings. Navigate to **Add-ons** in the main menu to create and manage these additional services. Each add-on can be configured with specific pricing models and quantity limits.

<Tip>
  **Not sure if something should be a service or an add-on?** See [Structuring Your Services](/services/structuring-services) for guidance. In general, if a customer wouldn't book it on its own, it's an add-on.
</Tip>

**Common add-ons:**
- Extra hours of service
- Additional staff members
- Custom cups, sleeves, or branding
- Premium upgrades (syrups, milk options)
- Travel fees or special setup charges

## Add-on Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Creating Add-ons">
    Set up new add-ons with:
    - Display name
    - Description
    - Pricing structure
    - Quantity limits (for Per unit, Per unit per hour, and Per unit per guest)
    - Minimum price (optional, for variable-rate add-ons)
    - Add-on image

    ### Quantity Limits
    For **Per unit**, **Per unit per hour**, and **Per unit per guest** add-ons, set minimum and maximum quantity controls:

    - **Min Quantity**: Enforce minimum order requirements
    - **Max Quantity**: Prevent over-ordering or resource conflicts
    - **Default Quantity**: Uses minimum if set, otherwise defaults to 1

    **Examples**:
    - Cocktail tables: Min 2, Max 10 (event space limitations)
    - Bartenders: Min 1, Max 4 (staffing availability)
    - Photo booth props: Min 5, Max 25 (package deals)

    <Note>
      Quantity limits only apply to Per unit, Per unit per hour, and Per unit per guest. Flat rate and other pricing models don't use these controls. Flat and Per unit do not use minimum price.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="money-bill" title="Pricing Options">
    Configure pricing models:
    - **Flat rate**: Fixed price regardless of quantity
    - **Per unit**: Price multiplied by quantity ordered
    - **Per guest**: Price based on guest count
    - **Per hour**: Price based on service duration
    - **Per resource**: Price based on resources used
    - **Per unit per hour**: Combined unit and hourly pricing
    - **Per unit per guest**: Price per unit scaled by guest count (and number of days); quantity is applied at line level (e.g. per-guest cocktail pricing with multiple options)

    ### Minimum Price (Optional)
    For variable-rate add-ons (**Per guest**, **Per hour**, **Per resource**, **Per unit per hour**, **Per unit per guest**), you can set an optional minimum price. If the calculated price is below this amount, the minimum is used. Leave blank for no minimum. Flat rate and Per unit do not use minimum price.

    <Tip>
      Choose pricing models that align with your operational costs and market positioning.

## Add-on Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Settings Control">
    Manage add-on details:
    - Availability status
    - Display order
    - Category assignment
    - Required resources
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="image" title="Visual Presentation">

    - Feature highlights
    - Upsell messaging
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="calculator" title="How Pricing Works">
    **Per unit per guest**: Unit price × guests × days, then × quantity (e.g. $1 per guest per cocktail × 100 guests × 1 day = $100 per unit; quantity 3 = $300 total).

    **Minimum price**: If you set a minimum price, the line total will never be less than that amount for variable-rate add-ons.

    ### How Quantity Limits Work

    **Minimum Quantity**:
    - Prevents customers from ordering below your business requirements
    - Automatically sets as default quantity when customers add the item
    - Useful for items that require minimum orders to be profitable

    **Maximum Quantity**:
    - Prevents over-ordering beyond your capacity
    - Helps manage resource allocation and logistics
    - Protects against inventory shortages

    **Common Use Cases**:
    - Audio equipment: Min 1 speaker, Max 8 speakers (venue size limits)
    - Linens: Min 10 napkins, Max 200 napkins (bulk order efficiency)
    - Staff: Min 1 server, Max 6 servers (team size management)
  </Accordion>

## Service-Specific Add-ons

If certain add-ons only apply to specific services, you can restrict them from the service detail page. Navigate to **Services**, click on a service, and use the **Available Add-ons** section to select which add-ons are relevant.

When a customer selects that service on a quote request form, only the linked add-ons will be shown. Leaving the list empty means all add-ons remain available.

- **Multiple services** — the customer sees every add-on allowed by any of the selected services
- **Add-on options update instantly** as customers change their service selection on forms

<Note>
Add-ons that an admin has already added as line items on a quote are always shown, regardless of service restrictions.
</Note>
