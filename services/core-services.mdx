## Service Categories

Organize services for easy selection:

- Catering (appetizers, full meals, dessert stations)
- Entertainment (DJ, live music, games)
- Equipment (lighting, sound, furniture)

## Service Descriptions

Write clear descriptions that sell:

✓ **Good**: "Full-service mobile bar with professional bartender, premium liquor selection, and custom cocktail menu for 4-hour events"

✗ **Too vague**: "Bar service available"

✗ **Too long**: Three paragraphs explaining every detail

## Pricing Integration

Services connect to your pricing models:
- **Hourly rates**: $75/hour for bartender service
- **Flat packages**: $1,200 for complete photo booth setup
- **Per-person pricing**: $25/guest for appetizer service

## What Happens Next

Services appear in:
- Quote generation forms
- Customer booking pages
- Invoice line items

## Common Issues

**Service not appearing in quotes**: Check availability rules and make sure service is active

**Pricing seems wrong**: Verify the pricing model matches your intended structure (hourly vs. flat rate)

**Customers confused by description**: Keep descriptions focused on value and what's included
