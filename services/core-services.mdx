## Create Your First Service

Navigate to **Services** in the main menu and click **New Service**.

**Service fields:**
- **Service Name**: What customers see on quotes (e.g., "Mobile Bar Service")
- **Description**: Brief explanation for customers
- **Line Item Description**: How it appears on invoices

## Service Pricing Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Pricing Structure">
    Each service can have multiple pricing components:

    **Base Price**: The starting price for your service
    - Sets the foundation cost
    - Can be a flat fee or starting point for calculations

    **Hourly Rate per Staff**: Price per hour per staff member
    - Multiplied by number of staff and hours
    - Great for labor-intensive services

    **Price per Guest**: Additional charge per attendee
    - Scales with event size
    - Perfect for consumption-based services

    **Minimum Price**: The lowest you'll accept
    - Ensures profitability on all bookings
    - Overrides calculated prices if they're too low

    <Tip>
      Your final price = Base Price + (Staff × Hours × Hourly Rate) + (Guests × Per Guest Rate), with the Minimum Price as a floor.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="image" title="Service Presentation">
    Make your service appealing:

## Service Examples

**Popular service types:**
- Bar Services (mobile bar, bartending, cocktail packages)
- Photo Services (booth, photographer, instant prints)
- Catering (appetizers, full meals, dessert stations)
- Entertainment (DJ, live music, games)
- Equipment (lighting, sound, furniture)

## Service Descriptions

Write clear descriptions that sell:

✓ **Good**: "Full-service mobile bar with professional bartender, premium liquor selection, and custom cocktail menu for 4-hour events"

✗ **Too vague**: "Bar service available"

✗ **Too long**: Three paragraphs explaining every detail

## Pricing Examples

Common pricing strategies:
- **Hourly services**: Base $200 + $75/hour per bartender
- **Flat packages**: Base $1,200 for photo booth (4-hour minimum)
- **Per-person services**: Base $500 + $25/guest for catering

## Service-Specific Add-ons

To show only relevant add-ons for a service, link them from the service detail page.

To configure:
1. Go to **Services** and click on a service
2. Find the **Available Add-ons** section
3. Click the edit icon and select the add-ons that apply to this service
4. Save your changes

<Info>
Leaving the add-on list empty means **all add-ons are available** for that service.
</Info>

**How it works with multiple services:**
When a customer selects multiple services on a form, they see every add-on allowed by any of the selected services. If any selected service has no restrictions, all add-ons are shown.

For example:
- "Mobile Bar" allows: Extra Hours, Premium Spirits, Custom Cups
- "Photo Booth" allows: Extra Hours, Backdrop Upgrade
- Customer selects both → all four add-ons are shown

## Service-Specific Resources

To control which resources can fulfill a specific service, link them from the service detail page.

To configure:
1. Go to **Services** and click on a service
2. Find the **Available Resources** section
3. Click the edit icon and select the resources that can deliver this service
4. Save your changes

<Info>
Leaving the resource list empty means **all resources are available** for that service. Only configure this if certain equipment is specific to certain services.
</Info>

**How it affects availability:**
The date picker on your lead intake form reflects only the resources eligible for the selected services. Quote presentation and booking form availability badges also update based on eligible resources.

For quotes with multiple restricted services, only resources eligible for **all** services count toward availability.

For example:
- "Espresso Bar" is restricted to: Cart A, Cart B
- "Cocktail Bar" is restricted to: Cart B, Cart C
- A quote with both services → only Cart B counts toward availability

<Tip>
If you run multiple service types with different equipment, restricting resources per service prevents availability conflicts.
</Tip>

## What Happens Next

Services appear in:
- Quote generation forms
- Customer booking pages
- Invoice line items
- Calendar scheduling

## Common Issues

**Service not appearing in quotes**: Check availability rules and make sure service is active

**Pricing seems wrong**: Verify the pricing model matches your intended structure (hourly vs. flat rate)

**Customers confused by description**: Keep descriptions focused on value and what's included
