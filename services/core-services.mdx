## Create Your First Service

Navigate to **Services** in the main menu and click **New Service**.

**Service fields:**
- **Service Name**: What customers see on quotes (e.g., "Mobile Bar Service")
- **Description**: Brief explanation for customers

## Service Pricing Configuration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Pricing Structure">
    Each service can have multiple pricing components:

    **Base Price**: The starting price for your service
    - Sets the foundation cost
    - Can be a flat fee or starting point for calculations

    **Hourly Rate per Staff**: Price per hour per staff member
    - Multiplied by number of staff and hours
    - Great for labor-intensive services

    **Price per Guest**: Additional charge per attendee
    - Scales with event size
    - Perfect for consumption-based services

    **Minimum Price**: The lowest you'll accept
    - Ensures profitability on all bookings
    - Overrides calculated prices if they're too low

    <Tip>
      Your final price = Base Price + (Staff × Hours × Hourly Rate) + (Guests × Per Guest Rate), with the Minimum Price as a floor.
    </Tip>

## Service Descriptions

Write clear descriptions that sell:

✓ **Good**: "Full-service mobile bar with professional bartender, premium liquor selection, and custom cocktail menu for 4-hour events"

✗ **Too vague**: "Bar service available"

✗ **Too long**: Three paragraphs explaining every detail

## Pricing Examples

Common pricing strategies:
- **Hourly services**: Base $200 + $75/hour per bartender
- **Flat packages**: Base $1,200 for photo booth (4-hour minimum)
- **Per-person services**: Base $500 + $25/guest for catering

## What Happens Next

Services appear in:
- Quote generation forms

- Invoice line items
- Calendar scheduling

## Common Issues

**Service not appearing in quotes**: Check availability rules and make sure service is active

**Pricing seems wrong**: Verify the pricing model matches your intended structure (hourly vs. flat rate)

**Customers confused by description**: Keep descriptions focused on value and what's included
