## How Service Pricing Works

In Flashquotes, pricing is configured directly on each service. You can combine multiple pricing components to create the perfect pricing structure for your business.

## Pricing Components

Each service can use any combination of these pricing elements:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Base Price">
    The foundation of your pricing:
    - Fixed amount added to every quote
    - Use for setup fees, minimum charges, or equipment costs
    - Can be the entire price for simple flat-rate services

    **Example**: $500 base for photo booth rental
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Hourly Rate per Staff">
    Labor-based pricing:
    - Charged per hour, per staff member
    - Automatically multiplies by hours and staff count
    - Perfect for services requiring skilled labor

    **Example**: $75/hour per bartender
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="users" title="Price per Guest">
    Scale with event size:
    - Added cost for each attendee
    - Great for consumption-based services
    - Helps cover variable costs

    **Example**: $15 per guest for appetizer service
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Minimum Price">
    Protect your profitability:
    - Sets the absolute minimum you'll accept
    - Overrides calculated price if it's too low
    - Ensures every booking meets your minimum requirements

    **Example**: $800 minimum for any event
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing Formula

Your service price is calculated as:

```
Final Price = MAX(
  Base Price + (Staff × Hours × Hourly Rate) + (Guests × Per Guest Rate),
  Minimum Price
)
```

This ensures you're always paid at least your minimum while allowing flexible pricing based on event specifics.

## Common Pricing Strategies

### Flat Rate Services

**Setup**: High base price, no hourly or per-guest charges

**Example**:
- DJ Service: $1,500 base price
- Covers up to 5 hours
- Simple, predictable pricing

### Hourly Services

**Setup**: Low/no base price, strong hourly component

**Example**:
- Bartending: $100 base + $75/hour per bartender
- Scales with event duration
- Fair for both short and long events

### Per-Person Services

**Setup**: Base price for minimums, per-guest for scaling

**Example**:
- Catering: $500 base + $25 per guest
- Covers fixed costs + variable food costs
- Profitable at any event size

### Hybrid Pricing

**Setup**: Combine all elements for sophisticated pricing

**Example**:
- Full Bar Service:
  - $300 base (equipment/setup)
  - $75/hour per bartender (labor)
  - $12 per guest (supplies)
  - $1,000 minimum

## Add-On Pricing

In addition to service pricing, you can create add-ons with their own pricing models:

- **Flat rate**: Fixed price add-ons
- **Per unit**: Quantity-based pricing
- **Per guest**: Scales with attendance
- **Per hour**: Time-based add-ons
- **Per resource**: Resource-dependent pricing
- **Per unit per hour**: Combined pricing

## Service Charges

You can also apply automatic service charges (like gratuity or delivery fees) that calculate as a percentage or flat fee on top of your service pricing.

Navigate to **Settings → Service Charges** to configure these additional fees.
