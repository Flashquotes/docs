## Pricing Model Types

Choose the right model for each service:

**Hourly Pricing**: Best for services where time varies (bartending, photography)
**Flat Rate**: Fixed price regardless of time (equipment rental, setup fees)
**Per Person**: Price scales with guest count (catering, favors)
**Tiered Pricing**: Different rates based on duration or quantity

## Setting Up Pricing

Navigate to your service settings and select **Pricing Configuration**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Hourly Pricing">
    Configure time-based rates:
    - **Base hourly rate**: Your standard rate
    - **Minimum hours**: Shortest booking allowed
    - **Overtime rates**: Premium for extended hours

    **Example setup:**
    - Bartender: $75/hour, 4-hour minimum
    - Overtime: $100/hour after 8 hours
    - Travel time: $50/hour for setup/breakdown

    <Tip>
      Set minimums that cover your costs. A 2-hour minimum prevents unprofitable short bookings.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="dollar-sign" title="Flat Rate Pricing">
    One price for the complete service:
    - **Package price**: Total cost regardless of time
    - **What's included**: Clear scope definition
    - **Add-on compatibility**: What extras can be added

    **Best for:**
    - Photo booth packages ($800 for 4 hours with props)
    - DJ services ($1,200 including equipment and music)
    - Delivery fees ($150 within 25 miles)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="users" title="Per-Person Pricing">
    Price scales with guest count:
    - **Rate per person**: Your per-guest charge
    - **Minimum guests**: Lowest profitable count
    - **Maximum capacity**: Your service limit

    **Perfect for:**
    - Catering: $22/person for appetizer service
    - Photo favors: $8/person for instant prints
    - Welcome drinks: $12/person for signature cocktails

    <Note>
      Include a reasonable minimum to ensure profitability even for small events.

## Pricing Strategy Tips

1. **Cover all costs**: Include travel, setup time, and overhead
2. **Research competitors**: Price competitively but don't undervalue yourself
3. **Test pricing**: Start higher and adjust based on booking rate
4. **Package strategically**: Bundle services for higher average orders

## What Customers See

Your pricing appears on:
- Quote presentations with clear breakdowns
- Booking forms with real-time calculations
- Invoices with itemized costs
- Proposal PDFs with professional formatting

## Common Issues

**Quotes too high**: Check if you're double-charging (service + hourly rate)

**Pricing confusing customers**: Simplify descriptions and use round numbers when possible

**Losing bookings to price**: Consider value-adds instead of just lowering rates
