Services in Flashquotes work best when they represent clear, bookable experiences—not every variation or add-on. This guide walks through how to design them so your menu stays simple, powerful, and easy to quote.

## What Is a Service?

A **Service** is a core package or experience that a client can book on its own.

<Tip>
  **The litmus test:** If a client saw this on your site, could they book *just this* and have it make sense?
</Tip>

A good service describes an **experience**—what happens, for how long, for what kind of event—not just a single line item.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Good service examples">
    - Espresso Bar Experience
    - Hot Chocolate Cart
    - Matcha & Tea Bar
    - Premium Coffee & Pastry Station
    - Full Mobile Bar Service

    Each is a distinct, bookable experience.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="xmark" title="These should NOT be services">
    - Additional Hour
    - Extra Barista
    - Custom Cups
    - Logo Cup Sleeves
    - Whipped Cream Topping

    These belong as [add-ons](/services/add-ons) or [pricing rules](/services/pricing), layered onto a core service.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Basic Structure of a Service

Every service should answer three questions:

| Question | What to include |
|----------|-----------------|
| **What is the experience?** | Simple, clear name and a short description of who it's for and what guests get |
| **What's included by default?** | Drinks/food offered, typical duration, standard staffing, and basics (cups, syrups, milks) |
| **What can change with pricing rules?** | Duration, guest counts, event types—the price changes, but the service stays the same |

## One Service, Many Prices

Instead of creating separate services like:

<CodeGroup>
```text Don't do this
Espresso Bar – 2 Hours
Espresso Bar – 3 Hours  
Espresso Bar – Wedding
Espresso Bar – Corporate
```

```text Do this instead
Espresso Bar Experience (one service)
├── Pricing rules for duration (2, 3, 4 hours)
├── Pricing rules for guest count brackets
└── Pricing rules for event types (Pro)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Example: Espresso Bar Service

<Card>
**Service name:** Espresso Bar Experience

**Description:** A full-service espresso cart with handcrafted lattes, cappuccinos, and more, served by professional baristas at your event.

**What's included:**
- 2 hours of service
- Unlimited espresso-based drinks
- Dairy + one non-dairy milk
- 3 standard syrups

**Pricing rules handle:**
- Additional hours (+$X per hour)
- Guest count brackets (0-50, 51-100, 101-200)
- Event type premiums/discounts (Pro feature)
</Card>

All of this stays under **one service**, so your menu is clean and easy for clients to understand.

## When to Use Add-ons Instead

Use an [add-on](/services/add-ons) when:

- It only makes sense on top of another service
- A client wouldn't book it by itself
- It describes extra time, upgrades, or customizations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="puzzle-piece" title="Common add-ons">
    - Extra hours of service
    - Additional barista or staff
    - Custom cups, sleeves, or branding
    - Upgraded syrups or premium milk options
    - Photo backdrop or decor upgrades
    - Travel fees or special setup charges
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  If you catch yourself naming something like "Espresso Bar – Extra Hour" as a service, that's a signal it should be an add-on instead.
</Warning>

## How Many Services Should I Have?

You'll get the best results with a **small, focused set** of services and more flexibility in add-ons and pricing rules.

| Business stage | Typical service count |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Side hustle / simple menu | 1-2 services |
| Growing business | 3-5 services |
| Multi-concept operations | More, but grouped by distinct experiences |

**Example lineup for a coffee caterer:**
- Espresso Bar Experience
- Hot Chocolate Cart
- Matcha & Tea Bar
- Bottled Lattes / Coffee To-Go

Each can have many internal pricing variations, but clients see a short, understandable list.

## Naming and Descriptions That Convert

### Naming tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Do this" icon="check">
    - Classic Espresso Bar Experience
    - Hot Chocolate & S'mores Cart
    - Cold Brew & Iced Tea Station

    Clear, experience-focused names.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Avoid this" icon="xmark">
    - Package 1
    - Service A
    - Espresso 2hr – Corporate (100-150 guests)

    Vague or overloaded with details.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Description tips

In 2-4 sentences, cover who it's for, what's included, and why it's special:

<Card>
  "Bring a full café experience to your event with our Espresso Bar. Guests enjoy handcrafted lattes, cappuccinos, and more, made to order by a professional barista. Includes a stylish mobile cart, premium beans, dairy and non-dairy milks, and three house syrups."
</Card>

Let your pricing rules and add-ons handle the details on hours, guest counts, and upgrades.

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Mistake: Every variation is a service">
    **Problem:**
    - "Espresso Bar – 2 Hours"
    - "Espresso Bar – 3 Hours"
    - "Espresso Bar – Wedding"

    **Fix:** Keep one "Espresso Bar Experience" service. Use [pricing rules](/services/pricing) for hours and event types.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="layer-group" title="Mistake: Add-ons modeled as services">
    **Problem:**
    - "Additional Hour"
    - "Add Second Cart"
    - "Logo Cups"

    **Fix:** Attach these as [add-ons](/services/add-ons) to the relevant services instead.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clone" title="Mistake: Too many overlapping services">
    **Problem:**
    - "Standard Espresso Bar"
    - "Premium Espresso Bar"
    - "Deluxe Espresso Bar"

    **Fix:** Consider one "Espresso Bar Experience" with add-ons or pricing rules for premium upgrades, unless they're truly distinct experiences.

## Service Structure Checklist

Before you publish, review each service:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Standalone test">
    Could a client book this on its own and immediately understand what they're getting?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Experience test">
    Does it describe an experience, not just a single line item?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Variations test">
    Are duration, guest counts, and event types handled by pricing rules instead of separate services?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extras test">
    Are extras (more time, more staff, more customization) handled as add-ons?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clarity test">
    Does the name make sense at a glance to someone who's never met you?
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you can answer "yes" to all of these, your service structure is in great shape.

## Next Steps

- [Configure pricing rules](/services/pricing) to handle variations
- [Create add-ons](/services/add-ons) for extras and upgrades
- [Set up your first service](/services/core-services)
