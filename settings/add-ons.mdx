Manage your add-ons from the Operations menu, not Settings.

## Where to find add-ons

Go to Operations > Add-ons to create and manage additional services for your quotes and bookings. Each add-on can be configured with specific pricing models and automation IDs for integration purposes.

## Creating add-ons

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to add-ons">
    Go to Operations > Add-ons in your dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add new add-on">
    Click "Create Add-on" to set up:
    - Unique identifier
    - Display name
    - Description
    - Pricing structure
    - Quantity limits (for per unit pricing)
    - Availability rules
  </Step>
</Steps>
    
### Quantity limits
For "Per Unit" priced add-ons, set minimum and maximum quantity controls:

- **Min Quantity**: Enforce minimum order requirements
- **Max Quantity**: Prevent over-ordering or resource conflicts
- **Default Quantity**: Uses minimum if set, otherwise defaults to 1

**Examples**:
- Cocktail tables: Min 2, Max 10 (event space limitations)
- Bartenders: Min 1, Max 4 (staffing availability)
- Photo booth props: Min 5, Max 25 (package deals)

<Note>
Quantity limits only apply to per-unit pricing. Flat rate and other pricing models don't use these controls.
</Note>

<Note>
Unique IDs are essential for automation workflows and integrations.
</Note>

## Pricing options

Configure pricing models:
- Per unit pricing
- Flat rate pricing
- Hourly rates
- Resource-based pricing

<Tip>
Choose pricing models that align with your operational costs and market positioning.

## Integration setup

</Warning>

**Pricing rules**:
- Quantity limits for per-unit add-ons
- Minimum and maximum order requirements
- Bundle discounts

### How quantity limits work

**Minimum Quantity**:
- Prevents customers from ordering below your business requirements
- Automatically sets as default quantity when customers add the item
- Useful for items that require minimum orders to be profitable

**Maximum Quantity**:
- Prevents over-ordering beyond your capacity
- Helps manage resource allocation and logistics
- Protects against inventory shortages

**Common use cases**:
- Audio equipment: Min 1 speaker, Max 8 speakers (venue size limits)
- Linens: Min 10 napkins, Max 200 napkins (bulk order efficiency)
- Staff: Min 1 server, Max 6 servers (team size management)

## Best Practices

1. Use clear, descriptive names
