## Overview

Branding settings let you upload your company logo and set brand colors. This applies to forms, quotes, and other client-facing elements.

**When you need this:** After completing company setup to maintain brand consistency.

## Upload Logo

Steps:
1. Go to Settings > Branding
2. Click "Upload Logo" or drag image to upload area
3. Select your logo file (PNG, JPG, or SVG recommended)
4. Logo appears immediately on forms and quotes

**What happens next:** Your logo displays on all client-facing pages.

**Common issues:**
- Logo appears blurry: Use high-resolution image (minimum 200px wide)
- Logo too large: Flashquotes automatically resizes, but smaller files load faster

## Set Brand Colors

Steps:
1. Scroll to Brand Colors section
2. Click the color picker
3. Select your primary brand color
4. Preview changes in real-time
5. Click Save

**What happens next:** Forms and quotes use your brand color for buttons and accents.

**Common issues:**
- Color doesn't match website: Use your website's exact hex code
- Poor contrast: Ensure color works with white text for accessibility

## What Gets Branded

Your logo and colors apply to:
- Lead intake forms
- Quote pages
- Booking confirmation pages
- Invoice headers

**Note:** Advanced form styling and email template customization are not currently available.
