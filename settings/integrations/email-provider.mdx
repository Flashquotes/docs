Use Google Workspace/Gmail for the best Flashquotes experience. Other email providers work but with major limitations.

## Why Google Workspace is strongly recommended

With Gmail integration, you unlock these features:

### Professional email sending
- Send quotes and invoices from your business email (not generic Flashquotes addresses)
- Customers see your company name and domain in their inbox
- Better deliverability and trust with recipients

### Complete email activity tracking
- See all email conversations with leads in one place
- Automatic email sync shows replies and responses
- Thread management keeps conversations organized

### Two-way communication
- Reply to customer emails directly from Flashquotes
- View entire email history with each lead
- Compose and send emails without leaving the platform

### Advanced automation
- Auto-watching for new emails and replies
- Real-time email activity updates
- Workflow triggers based on email interactions

### Reliable delivery with fallback
- Primary sending through your Gmail account
- Automatic fallback to Flashquotes servers if Gmail fails
- Never miss sending important quotes or invoices

## What happens without Gmail

If you don't connect Gmail:
- Emails send from generic Flashquotes.com addresses
- No email activity feed or conversation history
- Can't reply to customers from within Flashquotes
- Missing automated email tracking features
- Less professional appearance to customers

## Connect Gmail

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to integrations">
    Go to Settings > Integrations in your Flashquotes dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Gmail account">
    Find the Google section and click "+ Add account"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in">
    Sign in with your business Gmail account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    Grant permissions for sending and reading emails
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common issues

- **Can't see email activity**: Reconnect with expanded permissions enabled
- **Multiple accounts needed**: Connect additional Gmail accounts as needed for team members

<Note>
Google Workspace gives you the complete Flashquotes experience. Other providers work for basic quote sending but you'll miss the powerful email management features that make customer communication seamless.
