<Note>
**Pro subscription required.** Analytics tracking is available on the Flashquotes Pro plan. [Learn more about upgrading](https://flashquotes.com/pricing).
</Note>

Track when leads view your forms, start filling them out, and successfully submit. This data flows directly to Google Analytics 4 so you can measure your marketing effectiveness.

## What gets tracked

Flashquotes automatically sends these events to your GA4 property when visitors interact with your lead intake forms:

| Event | When it fires | What it tells you |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| `form_view` | Form page loads | How many people see your form |
| `form_start` | First field interaction | How many people start filling out your form |
| `generate_lead` | Successful submission | How many leads you captured |

Each event includes:
- **form_id** - The unique identifier for your form
- **form_name** - The name you gave your form in Flashquotes
- **UTM parameters** - utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_term, utm_content (when present in URL)

The `generate_lead` event also includes:
- **lead_id** - The Flashquotes lead ID
- **quote_id** - The associated quote ID (if created)

## Set up GA4 tracking

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your GA4 Measurement ID">
    Your Measurement ID looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`. Find it in your Google Analytics account:
    1. Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
    2. Click **Admin** (gear icon)
    3. Under **Property**, click **Data streams**
    4. Select your web stream
    5. Copy the **Measurement ID** (starts with `G-`)

    [Google's guide to finding your Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9539598)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Flashquotes">
    1. Go to **Settings > Integrations**
    2. Find the **Google Analytics** card
    3. Click **Connect** and paste your Measurement ID
    4. Click **Save**

    <Tip>
    You can also access this setting from **Forms > [Your Form] > Settings** under the **Tracking & Analytics** section.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify tracking is working">
    1. Open your lead intake form in a new browser tab
    2. In Google Analytics, go to **Reports > Realtime**
    3. You should see a `form_view` event appear within a few seconds
    4. Fill out a test field to trigger `form_start`
    5. Submit the form to trigger `generate_lead`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using UTM parameters

Flashquotes automatically captures UTM parameters from your form URLs and includes them in all events. This lets you track which marketing campaigns drive the most leads.

**Example URL with UTM parameters:**
```
https://yoursite.com/get-quote?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=summer_promo
```

These parameters will be included in all three events (form_view, form_start, generate_lead), so you can build reports showing:
- Which sources drive the most form views
- Which campaigns have the best form completion rates
- Which channels generate the most leads

## Build reports in GA4

### Create a conversion funnel

1. In GA4, go to **Explore**
2. Create a new **Funnel exploration**
3. Add steps: form_view → form_start → generate_lead
4. See your form conversion rates

### Track lead sources

1. Go to **Reports > Acquisition > Traffic acquisition**
2. Add a secondary dimension of "Event name"
3. Filter to show only `generate_lead` events
4. See which sources drive the most leads

## Best practices

1. **Test before launching campaigns** - Submit a test lead and verify events appear in GA4 Realtime before spending on ads
2. **Use consistent UTM parameters** - Create a UTM naming convention for your team
3. **Set up GA4 conversions** - Mark `generate_lead` as a conversion event in GA4 for easier reporting
4. **Connect Google Ads** - Link GA4 to Google Ads to import conversions for better ad optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Events not appearing in GA4

1. **Check Measurement ID format** - Must start with `G-` followed by 6-12 alphanumeric characters
2. **Wait a few minutes** - GA4 can have a slight delay; use Realtime reports for faster verification
3. **Check for ad blockers** - Browser extensions may block GA4 tracking
4. **Verify Pro subscription** - Analytics tracking requires Flashquotes Pro

### Duplicate events

- Each page load should trigger one `form_view`
- If you see duplicates, check that you haven't also added GA4 tracking manually to the page

### UTM parameters not tracking

- UTM parameters must be in the URL when the form loads
- Check that your marketing links include the UTM parameters
- Parameters are case-sensitive
