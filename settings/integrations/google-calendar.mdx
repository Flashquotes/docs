## How calendar sync works

**Events are created when:**
- A quote is booked by your customer
- You create a manual booking in Flashquotes
- You copy a booking with events

**Events are updated when:**
- You change booking details (date, time, location)
- Event name or description changes
- Shift times change

**Events are deleted when:**
- You cancel or delete a booking in Flashquotes
- You disconnect a Google account that was syncing to calendar
- You change which Google account syncs calendar for a location

**Event details included:**
- **Title:** Event name
- **Time:** Shift start/end
- **Location:** Event venue address
- **Description:** Event details and link to Flashquotes
- **Source:** Shows "Flashquotes" as the event source

## View sync status and trigger manual sync

You can check calendar sync status and manually trigger syncs directly from Flashquotes.

**Where to find sync status:**
- The Google Calendar icon in the event logistics and calendar event details conveys the status
- If the event is synced, the icon will be solid and will display the sync date on hover
- If the event is **not** synced, the icon will be transparent and you can click on it to trigger a manual sync

<Tip>
If an event shows "Failed" status, try the manual sync button before reconnecting your entire Google account.
</Tip>

## Manage calendar sync

**Change which calendar receives events:**
1. Go to Settings > Integrations > Configure Google
2. Select a different Google account for a location
3. Flashquotes will:
   - Remove future events from the old calendar
   - Create events in the new calendar for all future bookings

**Disable calendar sync for a location:**
1. Go to Settings > Integrations > Configure Google
2. Select "None" for the location
3. All future events will be removed from Google Calendar for that location

**Disconnect Google Calendar:**
- When you disconnect a Google account, all future calendar events created by Flashquotes are removed
- Past events remain in your calendar but won't receive further updates

<Warning>
Changing calendar sync settings affects all future events for that location. Review which locations use which Google accounts regularly.
</Warning>

## Best practices

1. **Configure calendar per company location** - Link calendars to company locations appropriately
2. **Don't manually edit synced events** - Changes in Google Calendar won't sync back; edit in Flashquotes
3. **Review sync settings regularly** - Ensure the right accounts sync to the right locations
4. **Use one calendar per business unit** - Keep different services or locations in separate calendars if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Calendar events not syncing
- Confirm you have an active Plus or Pro subscription
- Verify "Calendar Sync" permission is granted
- Check that calendar sync is configured for the location in Settings > Integrations > Configure
- Ensure this is a booked event (quotes don't sync)
- Try reconnecting your Google account

### Events not updating
- Verify your Google account is still connected
- Check that you're editing the booking in Flashquotes (not in Google Calendar)
- Allow a few minutes for updates to sync
- Reconnect your account if issues persist

### Events appearing in wrong calendar
- Check location calendar configuration in Settings > Integrations > Configure
- Update the Google account selection for that location
- Events will migrate to the correct calendar

### Events disappeared
- Check if your Google account was disconnected
- Verify calendar sync is still configured for the location
- Reconnect your account to resume syncing
