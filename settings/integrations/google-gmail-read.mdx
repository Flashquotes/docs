<Note>
Full Gmail integration requires Flashquotes Plus or Pro.
</Note>

Bring customer email conversations into Flashquotes to see the total context of customer communications within lead activity feeds.

## What gets synced

- Email threads between you and customers
- Replies and responses from customers
- Email timestamps and conversation context
- Automatic activity feed updates

**Where emails appear:**
- Lead activity feeds show all email correspondence with leads in one place
- You can find the activity feed on the lead details view and easily filter it for email

## How email syncing works

**Automatic monitoring:**
- Flashquotes monitors for new emails from customers
- Checks for new messages every few minutes

**Smart matching:**
- Emails are automatically linked to the correct lead
- Matching uses customer email addresses

**Real-time updates:**
- New email activity appears in activity feeds within minutes
- No manual action required

**Privacy first:**
- Only emails related to your Flashquotes leads are synced
- Other Gmail conversations remain private

<Warning>
If you disconnect your Google account, email syncing stops. Existing synced emails remain in activity feeds but no new emails are captured.
</Warning>

## Best practices

1. **Monitor activity feeds** - Check lead activity feeds regularly for new correspondence
2. **Keep account connected** - Don't disconnect unless necessary
3. **Use one primary account** - Connect the email account you use most for customer communication

## Troubleshooting

### Emails not appearing in activity feeds
- Confirm you have an active Plus or Pro subscription
- Verify "Read Email" permission is granted
- Check that the email address matches the lead email exactly
- Allow up to 15 minutes for new emails to sync
- Try reconnecting your Google account

### Old emails not syncing
- Email sync only captures recent conversations automatically
- When viewing the lead details a full email sync will trigger

### Some emails missing
- Verify the email address on the lead matches exactly
- Check that emails aren't in spam or trash
- Ensure the email is from/to a lead email address in Flashquotes

### Sync stopped working
- Check if your Google account is still connected
- Look for disconnection warnings in Settings > Integrations
- Reconnect your account if needed
