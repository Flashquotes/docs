## Best practices

1. **Use a business Google Workspace account** - More reliable than personal Gmail for business use
2. **Connect one primary account** - Use your main business email as default
3. **Keep permissions current** - Reconnect promptly if you see disconnection warnings

## Upgrading to Plus

Full Gmail integration and Google Calendar sync require Flashquotes Plus or Pro.
