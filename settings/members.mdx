<Note>
  You only need to invite admins to your workspace. Event staff can see
  everything they need without a Flashquotes account.
</Note>

## Inviting New Team Members

### Step 1: Access the Members Page

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the main navigation
2. Select **Members** from the sidebar

### Step 2: Send an Invitation

1. Click the **Invite Member** button in the top right corner
2. In the Invite Member dialog, enter the email address of the person you want to invite. **Be sure the email is tied to a Google account**, since they will need to sign in with Google to join your workspace.

3. **Select a Role**: Choose between:

   - **Admin** - Full access to all features and financial data
   - **Member** - Full access except for aggregate financial data

4. Click **Send Invitation**

<Note>
  The invited user will receive an email with a unique link to join your company
  workspace.
</Note>

### Step 3: User Acceptance

When a user receives an invitation:

1. They click the invitation link in their email
2. On the Invitation Page, they can:

- Sign in with Google
- Create a new account (if they don't have one)

3. After signing in, they're automatically added to your company workspace with the role you specified

## Team Roles and Permissions

Flashquotes supports two team member roles with different access levels:

### Admin Role

**Full access to all features including:**

- All booking management features
- All invoice and payment features
- All lead and quote management
- Company settings and configuration
- **Aggregate financial data** (revenue totals, payment statistics, etc.)
- Member management (invite, promote, demote other members)

### Member Role

**Full access to all features except:**

- Aggregate financial data (revenue totals, payment statistics)
- Member management (cannot invite, promote, or demote other members)

<Note>
  Members can still see individual invoice amounts and booking details, but they
  cannot see aggregate financial statistics like total revenue, overdue amounts,
  or payment summaries.
</Note>

### Changing Member Roles

Only admins can change member roles:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Members**
2. Find the member you want to modify
3. Click the dropdown menu (⋮) next to their name
4. Select **Promote to Admin** or **Demote to Member**

<Warning>
  Be careful when promoting members to admin roles, as they will gain access to
  all financial data and member management capabilities.
</Warning>

## Managing Invitations

### Tracking Invitation Status

- View all pending invitations under the "Invited" section on the Members page
- For pending invitations, click the dropdown menu to resend the invitation.

<Warning>
  Invitation links expire after 7 days. If a link expires, simply send a new
  invitation.
</Warning>

### Troubleshooting Invitations

If an invited user can't find their invitation:

1. Ask them to check their spam folder
2. Use the "Resend Invitation" option
3. If issues persist, [contact support](mailto:support@flashquotes.com)

After adding team members:

- Help them get familiar with [Flashquotes basics](/quickstart)
- Set up their [profile settings](/settings/my-profile)
- Review [company settings](/settings/general) together
