<Note>
  You only need to invite admins to your workspace. Event staff can see
  everything they need without a Flashquotes account.
</Note>

## Inviting New Team Members

### Step 1: Access the Members Page

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the main navigation
2. Select **Members** from the sidebar

### Step 2: Send an Invitation

1. Click the **Invite Member** button in the top right corner
2. In the Invite Member dialog, enter the email address of the person you want to invite. **Be sure the email is tied to a Google account**, since they will need to sign in with Google to join your workspace.

3. Click **Send Invitation**

<Note>
  The invited user will receive an email with a unique link to join your company
  workspace.
</Note>

### Step 3: User Acceptance

When a user receives an invitation:

1. They click the invitation link in their email
2. On the Invitation Page, they can:

- Sign in with Google
- Create a new account (if they don't have one)

3. After signing in, they're automatically added to your company workspace

## Managing Invitations

### Tracking Invitation Status

- View all pending invitations under the "Invited" section on the Members page
- For pending invitations, click the dropdown menu to resend the invitation.

<Warning>
  Invitation links expire after 7 days. If a link expires, simply send a new
  invitation.
</Warning>

### Troubleshooting Invitations

If an invited user can't find their invitation:

1. Ask them to check their spam folder
2. Use the "Resend Invitation" option
3. If issues persist, [contact support](mailto:support@flashquotes.com)

After adding team members:

- Help them get familiar with [Flashquotes basics](/quickstart)
- Set up their [profile settings](/settings/my-profile)
- Review [company settings](/settings/general) together
