## Overview

Profile settings (found at `/settings/profile`) let you control your email notification preferences. Personal information like name and email are read-only from your account session.

**When you need this:** To customize which email alerts you receive.

## Email Notifications

Steps:
1. Go to Settings > Profile (or visit `/settings/profile`)
2. Review available notification types:
   - New bookings
   - Payment receipts
   - Lead submissions
3. Toggle notifications on/off for each type
4. Changes save automatically

**What happens next:** You'll only receive emails for enabled notification types.

**Common issues:**
- Not receiving notifications: Check spam folder and verify email address
- Too many emails: Disable non-essential notifications

## Personal Information

Your name and email address display on the profile page but cannot be edited. These come from your account session.

**To update personal information:** Contact support or update through your authentication provider.

## Best Practices

1. Enable notifications for critical events (new bookings, payments)
2. Disable non-essential alerts to reduce email volume
3. Review settings when team roles change

## Next Steps

After configuring notifications:
- [Complete company settings](/settings/general)
- [Set up branding](/settings/branding)
- [Configure quote settings](/settings/quotes)
