## Application Fee

All plans include a Flashquotes application fee on each payment processed on our platform through Stripe. The fee is added on top of the invoice total and paid by your customer as a separate line item, resulting in **no cost to you**.

<Note>
The application fee is separate from [service charges](/settings/service-charges), which are business-defined fees you add to quotes (like gratuity or service fees).
</Note>

### Fees on Customer Refunds

When you issue a full refund to a customer, Stripe processing fees and Flashquotes application fees are **not** refunded. These fees remain on the invoice and will show as a Flashquotes fee paid by you (the merchant), since the original customer payment that covered the fee has been refunded.

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="How does the free trial work?">
