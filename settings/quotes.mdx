## Overview

Quote settings control how your quotes are presented to clients and set default parameters for quote generation. These settings help maintain consistency in your pricing and presentation while optimizing conversion rates.

## Quote Defaults

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Expiration Settings">
    Configure quote default expiration. Expired quotes can still be accessed and booked, but clients will see a message that the quote is expired.
    
    <Tip>
      Set expiration dates that create urgency while giving clients reasonable time to decide.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="map-location-dot" title="Service Area">
    Define service area radius:
    - Service radius limits in miles
    - Leads that have an address outside of this radius will be warned that there may be additional fees for travel
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quote Presentation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="image" title="Hero Content">
    Customize quote appearance:
    - Default hero message content
    - Default hero image selection
    
    <Note>
      The hero message is an excellent opportunity to showcase your value proposition to decision-makers.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="markdown" title="Markdown on Hero Message">
    <MarkdownSupport object="hero message" />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quote Delivery

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Custom Quote Email Subject">
    Set a custom subject line for all quote emails you send. Personalize your subject lines using lead-specific shortcodes to increase open rates and engagement.
    
    **Available Shortcodes:**
    - `{{lead.first_name}}` - Lead's first name (e.g., "John")
    - `{{lead.last_name}}` - Lead's last name (e.g., "Doe") 
    - `{{lead.full_name}}` - Lead's full name (e.g., "John Doe")
    - `{{lead.company_name}}` - Lead's company name (e.g., "Acme Inc")

    **Example Subject Lines:**
    - `☕ {{lead.first_name}}, your quote is ready!`
    - `✨ {{lead.full_name}}, review your quote from and book online in minutes!`

    <Tip>
      💡 Including emojis in your subject lines can boost open rates by making emails more visually appealing and less likely to be filtered as spam.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      If no custom subject is set, Flashquotes will use a default subject line. You can always edit the subject when sending individual quotes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Custom Quote Email Body">
    Click `Update` on *Custom quote email body* to set a custom text to use as your default for all quote emails you send.
    
    Emoji are welcome! 😃

    <Note>
      Want to use a different email body for quote? No problem, just edit it when sending the quote email.
    </Note>
