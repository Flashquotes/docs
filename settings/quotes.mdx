## Overview

Quote settings control how your quotes are presented to clients and set default parameters for quote generation. These settings help maintain consistency in your pricing and presentation while optimizing conversion rates.

## Quote Defaults

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Expiration Settings">
    Configure default quote expiration settings that apply to all new quotes. When quotes expire, customers can no longer book them directly - they'll be prompted to request a new quote or contact your company.

    ### How Quote Expiration Works

    When a quote is created, its expiration date is automatically set to whichever comes **first**:

    1. **Standard Expiration**: Current date + configured expiration days (default: 14 days)
    2. **Event-Based Expiration**: Midnight of the day before the event (in the event location's timezone)

    **Example:** If an event is scheduled for October 27 at 2:00 PM MST, the quote will expire on October 26 at 12:00 AM MST. This ensures customers have until the end of the day before the event to book, while giving you time to prepare.

    <Warning>
      Expired quotes cannot be booked. Customers viewing expired quotes will see options to request a fresh quote or contact you directly.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      Set expiration dates that create urgency while giving clients reasonable time to decide. You can extend individual quote expiration dates from the lead details, quote edit, or quote view pages.
    </Tip>

  <Accordion icon="map-location-dot" title="Service Area">
    Define service area radius:
    - Service radius limits in miles
    - Leads that have an address outside of this radius will be warned that there may be additional fees for travel
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing Rules

Configure automated pricing calculations used for instant quotes and travel fees.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="car" title="Travel Fee Calculation">
    Configure automatic travel fee calculations based on distance to event venues:

    ### Price Per Mile
    Set the rate charged per mile of travel. This rate applies to round-trip distance for each day and each [core resource](/resources).

    ### Minimum Travel Fee
    Set a minimum travel fee that applies per core resource per day. If the calculated distance-based fee is lower than this minimum, the minimum fee is used instead.

    ### How Travel Fees Are Calculated

    Travel fees use a per-resource, per-day formula:

    ```
    Travel Fee = MAX(
      Round Trip Miles × Days × Resources × Price Per Mile,
      Minimum Fee × Resources × Days
    )
    ```

    **Example**: For an event 28 miles away with 2 resources over 2 days:
    - Distance-based: 28 mi × 2 (round trip) × 2 days × 2 resources × \$0.75/mi = **$168**
    - Minimum-based: \$35 minimum × 2 resources × 2 days = **$140**
    - Final fee: **$168** (uses the higher of the two)

    <Note>
      Travel fees are automatically included in quote requests through your lead intake form when a location and event address are provided. The fee is distributed across service line items.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bolt" title="Instant Quoting Settings">
    Control how instant quotes behave when generated from your lead intake forms.

    ### Auto-Enroll in Workflow
    When enabled, all instant quotes are automatically enrolled in your quote follow-up workflow. This ensures consistent follow-up for every lead without manual intervention.

    <Tip>
      Combine auto-enrollment with a well-designed [quote follow-up workflow](/workflows) to maximize conversion rates on instant quotes.
    </Tip>

    ### High Ticket Threshold
    Set a maximum quote value for instant quoting. When a quote exceeds this threshold, it's routed to manual review instead of being sent automatically.

    **How it works:**
    - Quotes **at or below** the threshold are sent instantly to the customer
    - Quotes **above** the threshold are saved as drafts for your review
    - Leave empty to allow instant quotes at any price

    <Warning>
      The threshold is based on the quote subtotal (before taxes and discounts). Set this value carefully to balance automation with oversight on larger deals.
    </Warning>

    **Example**: With a $2,000 threshold:
    - $1,500 quote → Sent instantly to customer
    - $2,000 quote → Sent instantly to customer
    - $2,500 quote → Saved as draft for manual quoting
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quote Templates

Flashquotes supports multiple quote templates, allowing you to create different designs for different event types, services, or branding variations. Each template can have its own gallery images, testimonials, add-ons, hero message, and other visual elements.

## Quote Delivery

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Custom Quote Email Subject">
    Set a custom subject line for all quote emails you send. You can use any shortcode from the Quote Sent workflow to personalize subject lines (like `{{lead.first_name}}` or `{{company.name}}`).

    [See all available shortcodes →](/workflows/shortcodes/overview)

    **Example Subject Lines:**
    - `☕ {{lead.first_name}}, your quote is ready!`
    - `✨ {{lead.full_name}}, review your quote from and book online in minutes!`

    <Tip>
      💡 Including emojis in your subject lines can boost open rates by making emails more visually appealing and less likely to be filtered as spam.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      If no custom subject is set, flashquotes will use a default subject line. You can always edit the subject when sending individual quotes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Custom Quote Email Body">
    Set a custom default email body for all quote emails. You can use any shortcode from the Quote Sent workflow to personalize your message (like `{{lead.first_name}}` or `{{company.name}}`).

    [See all available shortcodes →](/workflows/shortcodes/overview)

    **Example Email Body:**
    ```
    Hi {{lead.first_name}},

    Thanks for requesting a quote! I've put together custom pricing for your event.

    Click the link below to review details and book online in minutes.

    Let me know if you have questions!
    ```

    **Live Preview:**
    As you type, the preview shows how your email will look with real lead data. This helps you verify formatting and personalization before saving.

    <Tip>
      Emoji work great in email bodies! They make messages feel personal and friendly. 😃
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      You can edit the email body when sending individual quotes if you need custom messaging for specific leads.
    </Note>
