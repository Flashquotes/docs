## Overview

Quote settings control how your quotes are presented to clients and set default parameters for quote generation. These settings help maintain consistency in your pricing and presentation while optimizing conversion rates.

## Quote Defaults

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Expiration Settings">
    Configure quote default expiration. Expired quotes can still be accessed and booked, but clients will see a message that the quote is expired.
    
    <Tip>
      Set expiration dates that create urgency while giving clients reasonable time to decide.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="map-location-dot" title="Service Area">
    Define service area radius:
    - Service radius limits in miles
    - Leads that have an address outside of this radius will be warned that there may be additional fees for travel
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quote Presentation

  <Accordion icon="image" title="Hero Content">
    Customize quote appearance:
