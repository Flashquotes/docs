## Overview

Quote settings control how your quotes are presented to clients and set default parameters for quote generation. These settings help maintain consistency in your pricing and presentation while optimizing conversion rates.

## Quote Defaults

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Expiration Settings">
    Configure default quote expiration settings that apply to all new quotes. When quotes expire, customers can no longer book them directly - they'll be prompted to request a new quote or contact your company.

    ### How Quote Expiration Works

    When a quote is created, its expiration date is automatically set to whichever comes **first**:

    1. **Standard Expiration**: Current date + configured expiration days (default: 14 days)
    2. **Event-Based Expiration**: Midnight of the day before the event (in the event location's timezone)

    **Example:** If an event is scheduled for October 27 at 2:00 PM MST, the quote will expire on October 26 at 12:00 AM MST. This ensures customers have until the end of the day before the event to book, while giving you time to prepare.

    <Warning>
      Expired quotes cannot be booked. Customers viewing expired quotes will see options to request a fresh quote or contact you directly.
    </Warning>

    <Tip>
      Set expiration dates that create urgency while giving clients reasonable time to decide. You can extend individual quote expiration dates from the lead details, quote edit, or quote view pages.

  <Accordion icon="map-location-dot" title="Service Area">
    Define service area radius:
    - Service radius limits in miles
    - Leads that have an address outside of this radius will be warned that there may be additional fees for travel

## Quote Presentation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="image" title="Hero Content">
    Customize quote appearance:
    - Default hero message content
    - Default hero image selection
    
    <Note>
      The hero message is an excellent opportunity to showcase your value proposition to decision-makers.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="markdown" title="Markdown on Hero Message">
    <MarkdownSupport object="hero message" />
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quote Delivery

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Custom Quote Email Subject">
    Set a custom subject line for all quote emails you send. You can use any shortcode from the Quote Sent workflow to personalize subject lines (like `{{lead.first_name}}` or `{{company.name}}`).

    [See all available shortcodes →](/workflows/shortcodes/overview)

    **Example Subject Lines:**
    - `☕ {{lead.first_name}}, your quote is ready!`
    - `✨ {{lead.full_name}}, review your quote from and book online in minutes!`

    <Tip>
      💡 Including emojis in your subject lines can boost open rates by making emails more visually appealing and less likely to be filtered as spam.
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      If no custom subject is set, flashquotes will use a default subject line. You can always edit the subject when sending individual quotes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Custom Quote Email Body">
    Set a custom default email body for all quote emails. You can use any shortcode from the Quote Sent workflow to personalize your message (like `{{lead.first_name}}` or `{{company.name}}`).

    [See all available shortcodes →](/workflows/shortcodes/overview)

    **Example Email Body:**
    ```
    Hi {{lead.first_name}},

    Thanks for requesting a quote! I've put together custom pricing for your event.

    Click the link below to review details and book online in minutes.

    Let me know if you have questions!
    ```

    **Live Preview:**
    As you type, the preview shows how your email will look with real lead data. This helps you verify formatting and personalization before saving.

    <Tip>
      Emoji work great in email bodies! They make messages feel personal and friendly. 😃
    </Tip>

    <Note>
      You can edit the email body when sending individual quotes if you need custom messaging for specific leads.
