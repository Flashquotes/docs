## Overview

Service charges add percentage-based or flat fees to quotes and invoices. Common uses: gratuity, service fees, corkage fees.

## Creating Service Charges

Navigate to **Settings > Service Charges** and click **Create Service Charge**.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Configuration">
    **Required fields:**
    - **Name**: e.g., "Service Fee", "Corkage Fee"
    - **Type**: Percentage or Flat Amount
    - **Value**: Percentage (0-100%) or dollar amount
    
    **Options:**
    - **Taxable**: Include in tax calculations
    - **Auto-Apply**: Add to all new quotes automatically
    
    <Note>
      Percentage charges calculate from quote subtotal before tax.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing Charges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="edit" title="Edit & Delete">
    - Toggle tax and auto-apply settings directly in the table
    - Delete charges with the trash icon (doesn't affect existing quotes)
    - Name and value cannot be edited after creation
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Works

**Calculation order:**
1. Quote subtotal (services + add-ons)
2. Service charges
3. Discounts
4. Tax
5. Final total

**Auto-applied charges** appear on new quotes but can be removed manually. **Manual charges** can be added individually when editing quotes.

## Common Examples

| Use Case | Type | Value | Taxable | Auto-Apply |
|----------|------|-------|---------|------------|
| Gratuity | Percentage | 20% | Yes | Yes |
| Corkage Fee | Flat | $75 | No | No |
| Service Fee | Percentage | 10% | Yes | Yes |
