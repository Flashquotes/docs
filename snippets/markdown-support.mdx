Flashquotes uses a rich text editor (TipTap) for content formatting throughout the platform. This provides a user-friendly, visual editing experience similar to Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

<Warning>
Flashquotes does not support markdown syntax. Content is created and edited using the visual rich text editor interface.
</Warning>

## Available Formatting Options

The rich text editor provides standard formatting tools:

### Text Styling
- **Bold text** - Use the bold button in the toolbar
- *Italic text* - Use the italic button in the toolbar
- Underlined text - Use the underline button in the toolbar

### Lists and Structure
- Bulleted lists
- Numbered lists
- Headings (H1, H2, H3)
- Paragraphs with proper spacing

### Links and Media
- Hyperlinks - Select text and use the link button
- Email links
- Image insertion (where supported)

## Where You'll Use the Rich Text Editor

The rich text editor appears in several areas of Flashquotes:

- Quote descriptions and notes
- Email templates and content
- Form instructions and help text
- Invoice notes and terms

## Tips for Best Results

- Use the formatting toolbar buttons rather than trying to type markdown syntax
- Preview your content before saving to ensure it displays correctly
- Keep formatting simple and professional for customer-facing content
- Use headings to organize longer content sections

<Note>
If you're familiar with markdown and prefer that workflow, the rich text editor may feel different initially. However, it provides better WYSIWYG editing for most users.
