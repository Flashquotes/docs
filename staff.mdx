## Overview

Flashquotes provides tools for managing your staff members, enabling team coordination and event assignments. Staff members are used for event assignments and can access event briefs, but they do not have login access to the Flashquotes system.

<Note>
  **Staff vs Team Members**: Staff members are used for event assignments and
  can access event briefs. To grant login access to your Flashquotes account,
  invite team members through the [Members](/settings/members) section instead.
</Note>
