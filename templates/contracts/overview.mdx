## How Contracts Work

Customers sign contracts during the booking flow, after filling out details but before payment. Once all signatures are complete, they proceed to payment or booking if no payment is required to book. The signed contract is saved and available for both you and your customer.

## Creating a Contract Template

1. Go to **Templates → Contracts**
2. Click **New Contract**
3. Give your contract a name
4. Use the rich text editor to write your contract
5. Add signature blocks where customers should sign
6. Save your template
