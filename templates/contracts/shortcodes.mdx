## Overview

Shortcodes automatically insert quote and lead information into your contracts. They ensure accurate, personalized contracts without manual data entry.

Shortcodes are formatted as `{{entity.attribute}}` and appear as highlighted tags in the editor.

## Available Shortcodes

Contracts support the same shortcodes available in [workflow emails](/workflows/shortcodes/overview) for the Quote Sent trigger.

### Lead Information

| Shortcode | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `{{lead.first_name}}` | Lead's first name | John |
| `{{lead.last_name}}` | Lead's last name | Doe |
| `{{lead.full_name}}` | Lead's full name | John Doe |
| `{{lead.email}}` | Lead's email address | john@example.com |
| `{{lead.company_name}}` | Lead's company name | Acme Inc |
| `{{lead.phone}}` | Lead's phone number | +1 234-567-890 |

## Using Shortcodes

1. Position your cursor where you want the shortcode
2. Type the shortcode exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
3. The shortcode highlights automatically when recognized
4. Preview your contract to verify shortcodes render correctly

<Tip>
  Shortcodes are case-sensitive. Use exactly as shown in the tables above.

## Shortcode Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Always preview">
    Use the preview feature to verify shortcodes render correctly before assigning the contract to quotes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="text" title="Use full names in formal sections">
    Use `{{lead.full_name}}` instead of `{{lead.first_name}}` in legal text and signature sections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="location-dot" title="Include complete addresses">
    Use `{{quote.event_address}}` for the full address rather than just city.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Show both start and end times">
    Include both `{{quote.event_start_time}}` and `{{quote.event_end_time}}` to clarify the service window.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Handle missing data">
    Some shortcodes may be empty if that information wasn't collected. Test with various quote types to ensure your contract reads well even with missing optional fields.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="question" title="Shortcode not highlighting?">
    - Check spelling and capitalization (they're case-sensitive)
    - Ensure you have both opening `{{` and closing `}}`
    - Verify you're using a valid shortcode from the tables above
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="question" title="Shortcode shows as text in preview?">
    - The shortcode may not be recognized - check the spelling
    - Some fields may be empty if data wasn't collected
    - Verify you're using quote-level shortcodes (contracts don't support booking-level shortcodes)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="question" title="Need shortcodes that aren't listed?">
    Contracts support the same shortcodes as Quote Sent workflow emails. Check the [workflow shortcodes documentation](/workflows/shortcodes/overview) for the complete list.
