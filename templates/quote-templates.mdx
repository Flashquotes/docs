## Assigning a Template to a Quote

You can change which template is assigned to a quote at any time:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Quote">
    Open the quote detail page for the quote you want to update.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Quote Template Tab">

  <Step title="Select Template">
    In the template selector dropdown at the top, select the template you want to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Update">
    The quote will automatically update to use the selected template.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The template selector shows:

- All available templates for your company
- Which template is currently assigned (marked with a checkmark)
- Which template is set as the default (marked with a star icon)
- An option to create a new template

When you change a quote's template, the quote immediately reflects the new template's settings, including gallery images, testimonials, add-ons, and other visual elements.

## Managing Templates

### Viewing All Templates

Navigate to **Templates** → **Quote Templates** to see all your quote templates. Each template card shows:

- A thumbnail preview (using the first gallery image, if available)
- The template name
- How many quotes are currently using the template
- When the template was last updated
- Whether it's set as the default template

### Setting a Default Template

The default template is automatically applied to new quotes. To set a template as default:

**From the Templates Page:**
1. Go to **Templates** → **Quote Templates**
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the template card
3. Select **Set as default**

**From the Template Editor:**
1. Click the three-dot menu in the top right
2. Select **Set as default**

<Note>
  Only one template can be the default at a time. Setting a new default automatically removes the default status from the previous default template.
</Note>

### Duplicating a Template

To create a copy of an existing template:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Templates">
    Go to **Templates** → **Quote Templates**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Menu">
    Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the template you want to duplicate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Duplicate">

  <Step title="Name Your Copy">
    Enter a name for the new template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Click **Duplicate Template**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The new template will be an exact copy of the original, including all gallery images, testimonials, add-ons, and other settings. You can then edit the duplicate independently.

### Deleting a Template

To delete a template:

1. Go to **Templates** → **Quote Templates**
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the template you want to delete
3. Select **Delete**
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  You cannot delete the default template. You must set another template as default first.
</Warning>

<Info>
  Deleting a template does not affect existing quotes that were created using that template. Those quotes will continue to display with the template settings they had when they were created.
</Info>

## Default Templates

Every company has one default template. The default template is:

- Automatically applied to new quotes when they're created
- Marked with a star icon and "Default" badge
- Protected from deletion (you must set another template as default first)

When you create your first template, it automatically becomes the default. You can change the default template at any time, and only one template can be the default at once.
