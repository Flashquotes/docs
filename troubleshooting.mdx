## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my clients not able to book me? They get an error message when they complete the booking form.">
    99% of the time, this issue occurs because your Stripe account is not properly connected or is on hold pending additional documentation.

    **Immediate Solution:**

    1. Go to **Settings → Company** in your Flashquotes dashboard
    2. Check if your Stripe account says "Connected"
    3. If it shows "Connect" or "Finish setting up", your Stripe account is not ready to receive payments

    <Warning>
      You must complete your Stripe account setup to use Flashquotes' payment
      features.
    </Warning>

    **Temporary Workaround:**
    If you need to accept bookings immediately while resolving Stripe issues:

    1. Change your quote's payment terms to not require a deposit
    2. Use "Invoice Only" [payment terms](/leads/booking-flow) so payment isn't required at booking
    3. This allows customers to book without immediate payment

    <Note>
      Even with this workaround, you'll still need to resolve your Stripe account
      issues to process invoice payments.
    </Note>

    **Common Stripe Account Issues:**

    - Incomplete verification
    - Missing business documentation
    - Account on hold for compliance review
    - Incorrect bank account information

  <Accordion title="How do I include a contract for my customers?">
    Our general recommendation is to add an acknowledgement type question to your booking form.

    **Implementation Steps:**

    1. Add an acknowledgement question to your booking form
    2. Word it something like: "I acknowledge that by completing this booking form I agree to the service terms and conditions of [Company Name]"
    3. Use a markdown hyperlink to link to your service contract on your web page

    **Example:**
    ```
    I acknowledge that by completing this booking form I agree to the
    [service terms and conditions](https://yourwebsite.com/terms) of Company X.
    ```

    <Tip>
      This approach ensures customers explicitly agree to your terms before booking, providing legal protection while maintaining a smooth booking experience.
    </Tip>

  <Accordion title="My form doesn't display correctly on mobile in Wix. What should I do?">
    Wix has unique technical constraints that affect how iframe embeds display on mobile devices, particularly a 320px width limit and sandboxed rendering.

    **Recommended Solution:**
    Use a hybrid approach - embed the form for desktop users, but on mobile, use a button that links to your form's hosted Share Link page.

    **Implementation:**
    1. Create a [Share Link](/forms/share-links) in your Flashquotes dashboard
    2. In Wix's mobile editor, hide the HTML iframe element
    3. Add a button like "Get Custom Pricing" or "Request Quote"
    4. Link the button to your Share Link URL

    This ensures mobile users get the full, responsive form experience without Wix's display constraints.

    **If you prefer to embed on mobile:**
    Follow the mobile optimization steps in our [Wix Embed Best Practices](/forms/wix-embeds) guide, including using fixed dimensions and testing on real devices.

    <Tip>
      For the best mobile conversion rates, we strongly recommend using Share Links for Wix mobile users instead of embedded iframes.
