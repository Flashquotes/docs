## What are Workflows?

Workflows enhances lead follow-up in Flashquotes with automated email sequences. Currently, one workflow is available: a 7-step quote follow-up sequence that automatically enrolls leads when you send quotes.

## Available Features

- **Quote Follow-up Workflow**: 7-step email sequence for quote follow-ups
- **Automated Timing**: Pre-configured follow-up intervals optimized for conversions
- **Dynamic Content**: Shortcodes automatically insert quote and lead details
- **Email Templates**: Pre-built templates ready to use

## How It Works

1. When sending a quote, toggle "Enroll in workflow" to activate the sequence
2. Leads automatically receive 7 follow-up emails over 30 days
3. Each email uses pre-configured templates with your quote details

## What's Included

The quote follow-up workflow includes:
- Welcome email (immediate)
- Follow-up reminders (scheduled intervals)
- Booking encouragement messages
- Final opportunity emails
