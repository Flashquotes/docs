## What are Workflows?

Workflows automate lead communication in Flashquotes with intelligent email sequences. The platform offers four workflow triggers: Quote Requested workflows that engage leads immediately after form submission, Quote Sent workflows that follow up after you send quotes, and event-based triggers (First Event Start and Last Event End) that automate communications around actual event dates.

## Available Features

- **Quote Requested Workflows**: Automatically engage leads the moment they submit your lead intake form
- **Quote Sent Workflows**: Customizable email sequence for quote follow-ups (starts with 7 pre-configured steps)
- **First Event Start Workflows**: Time-sensitive communications before, during, or after the first event begins
- **Last Event End Workflows**: Post-event follow-ups and re-engagement campaigns after the final event concludes
- **Flexible Workflow Management**: Add, edit, or delete workflow steps to match your sales process
- **Automated Timing**: Configure follow-up intervals optimized for your business
- **Automatic Rescheduling**: Event-based workflows reschedule when event dates change
- **Dynamic Content**: Shortcodes automatically insert quote, lead, and booking details
- **Email Templates**: Pre-built templates for Quote Sent workflows, fully customizable for others
- **Gmail Integration**: Choose which connected Gmail account sends workflow emails
- **Resume Capability**: Restart stopped workflows when leads re-engage

## How It Works

**Quote Requested Workflows:**
1. Create a workflow with the Quote Requested trigger
