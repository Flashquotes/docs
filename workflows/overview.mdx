## What are Workflows?

Workflows is a powerful feature in Flashquotes that enhances lead follow-up and engagement. Instead of just sending one-off emails to leads, you can now enroll them in structured workflows for specific quotes. Each workflow consists of predefined steps designed to optimize your follow-up process and improve booking conversions.

## Key Features

- **Automated Follow-ups**: Workflows provide best-practice follow-up sequences with predefined email steps
- **Customizable Templates**: Each email step includes fully customizable subject lines and body content
- **Dynamic Content**: Use shortcodes to automatically insert relevant quote and lead details into each email
- **Scheduled Sending**: Set up automated follow-ups at optimal intervals
- **Full Control**: Edit templates, timing, and messaging to match your business needs

## Accessing Workflows

1. Click on the **Workflows** tab in the main left navigation
2. This will open the predefined quote follow-up workflow
3. From here you can:
   - Preview email templates
   - Customize message content
   - Adjust timing of follow-ups
   - Test emails before sending to leads

## Previewing Templates

Before sending any workflows to leads, you can:

1. Click the **Preview** button within any workflow to see an example
2. Select a specific quote to see exactly how shortcodes will be parsed
3. Send a test email to your inbox for review
