Helper functions add flexibility to shortcodes in workflow templates. Currently, one helper function is available.

## Available Functions

- [Default Values](/workflows/shortcodes/helpers/default) - Specify fallback values when fields are empty

## Coming Soon

Additional helper functions are in development:
- If Conditions - Conditional content based on values
- Unless Conditions - Inverse conditional logic

These helpers are not yet implemented in the system.
