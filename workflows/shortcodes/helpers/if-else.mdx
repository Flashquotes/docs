<Warning>
	The `if` helper is not currently available in Flashquotes workflows. This feature is in development.
</Warning>

The `if` helper will allow you to conditionally include content based on whether a value exists.

## Planned Features

When available, the `if` helper will support:

- Basic conditional logic
- Else blocks for alternative content
- Multiple conditions in templates
- Nested conditions for complex logic

## Alternative Solution

For now, use the [default helper](/workflows/shortcodes/helpers/default) to provide fallback values when fields are empty.

## Coming Soon

This feature is in development. Check back for updates on availability.
