---

The `if` helper allows you to conditionally include content based on whether a value exists. You can add an `{{else}}` step to return a different value when the `if` check is empty/false.

<Warning>
	Empty values and zero (`0`) are considered false when evaluating an `if`
	condition.
</Warning>

<Tip>
	You can add an optional setting to [treat zero as
	true](/workflows/shortcodes/helpers/if-else#treat-zero-as-true).
</Tip>

### Basic Usage

```
{{#if lead.company_name}}
  Hello {{lead.full_name}} from {{lead.company_name}}!
{{else}}
  Hello {{lead.full_name}}!
{{/if}}
```

If `lead.company_name` exists:

```
Hello John Doe from Acme Inc!
```

If `lead.company_name` is empty:

```
Hello John Doe!
```

### Multiple Conditions

You can check multiple conditions in the same template:

```
{{#if quote.guest_count}}
  We're excited to serve your {{quote.guest_count}} guests!
{{else}}
  We're excited to serve your group!
{{/if}}

{{#if quote.number_of_staff}}
  Our team of {{quote.number_of_staff}} staff members will ensure everything runs smoothly.
{{/if}}
```

### Nested Conditions

You can nest conditions for more complex logic:

```
{{#if lead.company_name}}
  {{#if lead.phone}}
    We'll contact {{lead.company_name}} at {{lead.phone}}.
  {{else}}
    We'll contact {{lead.company_name}} via email.
  {{/if}}
{{else}}
  We'll be in touch soon!
{{/if}}
```

### Treat Zero as True

If you want the if statement to consider a value of `0` as true, use the optional `includeZero` setting.

For example, if your if statement was `{{#if 0 includeZero=true}}`, then a value of `0` would satisfy and trigger the value within the `if` statement.

## Best Practices

1. Always provide an `else` block for critical information
2. Use nested conditions sparingly to maintain readability
3. Test your templates with both filled and empty data
4. Consider using the [default helper](/workflows/shortcodes/helpers/default) for simpler fallback cases

<Tip>
	Preview your templates with different quotes to ensure your conditional logic
	works as expected in all scenarios.
