The `unless` helper is the inverse of the [`if` helper](/workflows/shortcodes/helpers/if-else). It executes the block if the conditional value is empty or equal to `0`.

<Tip>
	Think of `unless` as "if not" - it's particularly useful when you want to
	check if something is missing or empty.
</Tip>

## Basic Usage

```
{{#unless lead.phone}}
  Please provide a phone number for better communication.
{{/unless}}
```

If `lead.phone` is empty:

```
Please provide a phone number for better communication.
```

If `lead.phone` exists, nothing will be rendered.

## With Else Block

Like the `if` helper, `unless` can include an `else` block:

```
{{#unless quote.event_address}}
  Event location is pending
{{else}}
  Event location: {{quote.event_address}}
{{/unless}}
```

If `quote.event_address` is empty:

```
Event location is pending
```

If `quote.event_address` exists:

```
Event location: 123 Main St, Anytown, USA
```

## Common Use Cases

### Missing Contact Information

```
{{#unless lead.email}}
  {{#unless lead.phone}}
    No contact information provided.
  {{/unless}}
{{/unless}}
```

### Incomplete Quote Details

```
{{#unless quote.guest_count}}
  Guest count needs to be confirmed.
{{/unless}}

{{#unless quote.event_start_time}}
  Event start time is not set.
{{/unless}}
```

### Missing Company Information

```
{{#unless company.contact_phone}}
  Contact us at {{company.contact_email}}
{{else}}
  Call us at {{company.contact_phone}}
{{/unless}}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use `unless` when checking for missing or empty values
2. Consider using [`if`](/workflows/shortcodes/helpers/if-else) when the logic is complex or needs multiple conditions
3. Keep the logic simple and readable
4. Test templates with both empty and filled data

<Warning>
	Like the `if` helper, `unless` treats zero (`0`) as a falsy value. If you need
	to treat zero differently, consider using the `if` helper with
	`includeZero=true`.
</Warning>

## Comparison with If Helper

Here's the same logic written with both `unless` and `if`:

Using `unless`:

```
{{#unless lead.company_name}}
  Individual client
{{else}}
  Corporate client: {{lead.company_name}}
{{/unless}}
```

Equivalent using `if`:

```
{{#if lead.company_name}}
  Corporate client: {{lead.company_name}}
{{else}}
  Individual client
{{/if}}
```

Choose the one that makes your template more readable and intuitive.
