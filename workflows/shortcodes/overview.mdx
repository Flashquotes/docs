---

Shortcodes are dynamic placeholders that automatically insert relevant information into your workflow emails. They help personalize your messages and ensure accurate information is always included.

Short codes are formatted as `{{entity.attribute}}` and must be surrounded by `{{}}` to be translated to a dynamic value.

<Tip>
	After adding shortcodes to a message template, [preview
	it](/workflows/templates#testing-your-templates) with a quote to make sure
	they work as expected
</Tip>

## Available Shortcodes by Trigger

Specific shortcodes are only available for certain triggers - for example, `{{invoice.due_date}}` wouldn't be available for a **Quote Sent** trigger before there's a booking and invoice.
