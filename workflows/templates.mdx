## Understanding Workflow Templates

Workflow templates are pre-configured email sequences that help you maintain consistent and effective communication with your leads. Each template consists of multiple steps, with each step containing a customizable email message.

## Template Components

Each step in a workflow template includes:

- **Subject Line**: The email subject that your lead will see
- **Message Body**: The main content of your email
- **Timing**: When the email should be sent relative to the previous step
- **Shortcodes**: Dynamic placeholders that automatically insert relevant information

## Customizing Templates

### Editing Message Content

1. Navigate to the Workflows section
2. Select the template you want to edit
3. Click on any step to modify:
   - Subject line
   - Email body
   - Timing settings

### Using Shortcodes

Shortcodes automatically insert dynamic content into your emails. Common shortcodes include:

- `{{lead.full_name}}`: The lead's full name
- `{{quote.amount}}`: The quote amount
- `{{quote.event_start_date}}`: The date of the first event
- `{{company.name}}`: Your company name

### Testing Your Templates

Before activating a workflow:

1. Click the **Preview** button to see how your email will look
2. Select a specific quote to see how shortcodes will be replaced
3. Send a test email to verify everything appears correctly

## Best Practices

- Keep subject lines clear and engaging
- Personalize messages using shortcodes
- Space out follow-up emails appropriately
- Test templates before using them with leads
- Regularly review and update your templates based on engagement

## Managing Multiple Templates

While in beta, we have one workflow template for quote follow-up.

Soon you'll be able to add as many templates as you like.
