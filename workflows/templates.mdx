## Understanding Workflow Templates

Workflow templates are pre-configured email sequences for lead follow-up. The quote follow-up workflow includes 7 email templates designed for optimal conversion rates.

## What's Included

Each email template includes:

- **Subject Line**: Pre-written subject optimized for engagement
- **Message Body**: Professional content designed for conversions
- **Timing**: Optimized sending intervals (immediate to 30 days)
- **Shortcodes**: Automatic insertion of quote and lead details

## Template Sequence

The 7-step sequence includes:
1. Welcome email (immediate)
2. 3-day follow-up
3. 7-day reminder
4. 14-day check-in
5. 21-day final offer
6. 28-day last chance
7. 30-day archive notice

## Using Shortcodes

Templates include shortcodes that automatically insert your data:

- `{{lead.full_name}}`: The lead's full name
- `{{quote.event_start_date}}`: The date of the first event
- `{{company.name}}`: Your company name

## Customizing Your Workflow

While templates come pre-configured and ready to use, you have full control to customize them to fit your business needs:

### Adding New Steps

You can add additional steps to your workflow at any position:

1. Navigate to **Workflows** in the sidebar
2. Click on the Quote Follow-up workflow
3. Click **Add Step** between existing steps or at the end
4. The system automatically calculates a smart delay based on surrounding steps
5. Customize the email subject and message content for your new step

### Editing Step Content

Each workflow step includes an email template that you can customize:

1. Click on any workflow step to edit
2. Modify the subject line and message body
3. Use shortcodes to personalize content with lead and quote data
4. Changes are saved automatically

### Deleting Steps

Remove steps that don't fit your follow-up strategy:

1. Click on the workflow step you want to remove
2. Click the **Delete** button in the step editor
3. Confirm deletion - this will soft-delete the step and its message template

<Note>
Deleting a step will **immediately** prevent that step from being sent, even for active workflows.
</Note>

<Warning>
Adding a step only impacts **future workflow enrollments**. The new step will **not** be added to existing active workflows.
</Warning>

## How Templates Work

Templates are pre-configured and automatically activated when you:
1. Send a quote with "Enroll in workflow" enabled
2. The system sends emails according to the preset schedule
3. Each email uses the appropriate template for that step
