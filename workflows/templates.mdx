## Understanding Workflow Templates

Workflow templates are pre-configured email sequences for lead follow-up. The quote follow-up workflow includes 7 email templates designed for optimal conversion rates.

## What's Included

Each email template includes:

- **Subject Line**: Pre-written subject optimized for engagement
- **Message Body**: Professional content designed for conversions
- **Timing**: Optimized sending intervals (immediate to 30 days)
- **Shortcodes**: Automatic insertion of quote and lead details

## Template Sequence

The 7-step sequence includes:
1. Welcome email (immediate)
2. 3-day follow-up
3. 7-day reminder
4. 14-day check-in
5. 21-day final offer
6. 28-day last chance
7. 30-day archive notice

## Using Shortcodes

Templates include shortcodes that automatically insert your data:

- `{{lead.full_name}}`: The lead's full name
- `{{quote.amount}}`: The quote amount
- `{{quote.event_start_date}}`: The date of the first event
- `{{company.name}}`: Your company name

## How Templates Work

Templates are pre-configured and automatically activated when you:
1. Send a quote with "Enroll in workflow" enabled
2. The system sends emails according to the preset schedule
3. Each email uses the appropriate template for that step

No customization required - templates are ready to use.
