## Available Triggers

### Quote Sent Trigger

The primary trigger currently available in Flashquotes is the **Quote Sent** trigger.

This trigger automatically initiates a workflow when the **Send quote** action is taken and "Enroll in workflow" is toggled on.

<Frame>
	<img
		src="/images/workflows/quote-enroll.png"
		alt="Quote sending modal with enroll in workflow toggle"
	/>
</Frame>

When triggered, the workflow will:

- Begin the automated email sequence
- Schedule follow-up messages according to the _Quote follow-up workflow_ starter template
- Track engagement with the sent emails

## Coming Soon

We're actively working on expanding our trigger system. Future triggers **may** include:

- Quote requested
- Quote booked
- Invoice due
- First event start
- Last event end
- And more!

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance the workflow automation capabilities in Flashquotes.

## Best Practices

Even with a single trigger type, you can optimize your workflow usage by:

- Ensuring the "Enroll in workflow" toggle is enabled when needed
- Customizing the workflow template timing and content based on your business needs
- Using the preview feature to verify workflow behavior before sending
