## Available Triggers

### Quote Sent

The Quote Sent trigger automatically starts the workflow when you send a quote with "Enroll in workflow" enabled.

<Frame>
	<img
		src="/images/workflows/quote-enroll.png"
		alt="Quote sending modal with enroll in workflow toggle"
	/>
</Frame>

How it works:

1. Send a quote from the quotes page
2. Toggle "Enroll in workflow" before sending
3. The 7-step email sequence begins automatically
4. Emails send at preset intervals over 30 days

## Other Triggers

Additional triggers are in development and not yet available through the user interface.
