## Available Triggers

Flashquotes offers multiple workflow triggers to automate customer communications at different stages of the customer journey. Each trigger has access to specific shortcodes relevant to that stage.

### Quote Requested

The Quote Requested trigger automatically enrolls leads in workflows when they submit a quote request through your lead intake forms. This allows you to engage leads immediately after they express interest, before you even send a formal quote.

**How it works:**

1. A lead submits your lead intake form
2. Flashquotes automatically enrolls them in any active Quote Requested workflows
3. The email sequence begins immediately based on your configured timing
4. Workflows continue until the lead books or you stop them manually

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic Enrollment**: No manual action required - leads are enrolled as soon as they submit the form
- **Immediate Engagement**: Connect with leads during the critical window between request and quote delivery
- **Gmail Account Selection**: Choose which connected Gmail account sends the workflow emails
- **Customizable Templates**: Create email sequences tailored to new lead inquiries

**Common Use Cases:**
- Send immediate acknowledgment confirming quote request receipt
- Share your company story and build trust while preparing their quote
- Provide helpful event planning tips and resources
- Set expectations about your quote preparation timeline
- Answer common questions proactively

**Setting Up Quote Requested Workflows:**

To create a Quote Requested workflow:
1. Navigate to Workflows from your main navigation
2. Create a new workflow
3. Select "Quote Requested" as the trigger type
4. Add email steps with your desired timing and content
5. Publish the workflow to activate automatic enrollment

### Quote Sent

The Quote Sent trigger automatically starts the workflow when you send a quote with "Enroll in workflow" enabled.
