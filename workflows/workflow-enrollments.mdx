## Managing Active Workflows

### Stopping Workflows

You may want to stop an active workflow because the lead has replied and is engaging with your team or because they've said they no longer need your services.

You can stop workflows in several ways:

1. **From Quote View**:

   - Click "Stop all" in the workflow banner to stop all active workflows

<Info>
	The "Stop all" button stops workflow enrollments for this specific quote only.
	It does not affect workflow enrollments for other quotes this lead may have.
</Info>

2. **From Lead Workflows Tab**:
   - Select individual workflows to stop
   - You can easily click **Stop Workflow** on all active workflow for this lead

### Resuming Stopped Workflows

If you've stopped a workflow but want to restart the automated follow-up sequence, you can easily resume it:

1. Navigate to the **Lead Workflows Tab** in the lead details view
2. Locate the stopped workflow in the "Canceled Workflows" section
3. Click the **Resume Workflow** button (only visible if there are future scheduled steps)
4. The workflow will reactivate and continue sending scheduled emails

<Note>
You can only resume a workflow if it has scheduled steps in the future. Workflows that have completed all their steps cannot be resumed.
</Note>

**When to Resume Workflows:**
- The lead initially showed no interest but has now re-engaged
- You accidentally stopped a workflow too early
- The lead requested more time to consider and now wants to continue receiving information
- A communication misunderstanding has been resolved

### Automatically Stopping Workflows

When a lead books a quote, all active workflows for that lead will be stopped automatically

This includes workflows across multiple quotes that may be active

This automatic stopping ensures you maintain a professional relationship with your leads and don't continue sending sales-focused follow-ups after they've already decided to work with you.

<Warning>
	If a lead engages with you **before** booking, all active workflows will
	continue until you stop them manually.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

- Regularly review active workflows to ensure relevance
- Stop workflows if direct engagement begins with the lead
- Monitor email analytics to optimize workflow effectiveness
